## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to 
* bivariate plots
* histograms
* boxplots
* be aware of how to adjust plot appearnace
* know to save a plot made in base R

:::

Base R has some plain yet effective plotting techniques. These can be made publication quality or can be used for exploratory purposes. I find base plotting in R to be a very convenient for exploration of data.

#### As usual, start by loading data

```{r}
dataset <- read.csv(here::here("data", ))
```


## X-Y bivariate plots


## Histograms


## Boxplots

## Barplots




## Saving plots
