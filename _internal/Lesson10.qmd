## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should:

* be able to aggregate data and perform actions on those aggregated data
:::

You may find yourself wanting to calculate summary statistics across a grouping variable. To do this, a data set needs to be split up by that variable, a summary statistic calculated, and the resulting data recombined, or 'split-apply'combine'. There's some nice tools to do this in the **dplyr** package. 


First, load libraries & Import Data: 
```{r, }
library(dplyr)

variety_trials <- read.csv(here::here("data", "trial_data.csv"))
trial_metadata <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data", "trial_metadata.csv"))
```
