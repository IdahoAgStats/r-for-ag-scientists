title: "Lesson 7: Importing Data into R"
---





Things frequently go wrong when importing data. This can sometimes be corrected by changing the import arguments, but often it indicates problems with the incoming data.

Some possible errors and how to fix them:

1. **Some variables which should be numeric are characters instead.**
*At least one item contains an unexpected character that renders that observation - and the rest of the vector - as a character. This might be two decimal points, a comma, or a "O" instead of "0". If possible, manually inspect the data and correct the error. *

1. **Missing data are not coded as missing.**
*Import functions have default values for what is interpreted as missing. Check the documentation and adjust the arguments as needed to capture what code a data sets is using to indicate missing data.*

The best thing is to properly arrange your data set prior to import. [Broman & Woo (2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) provides some straightforward recommendations on how to manage data in spreadsheets.
