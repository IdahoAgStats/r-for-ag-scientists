title: "Preparing for this Class"
---

Welcome & salutations. I have fully revamped this curriculum, doing my best to recreate "beginner's mind", and am quite excited to teach this material. We have very limited time, so order to conserve class time and have us all ready for the first day of class, please read through this "Lesson Zero", watch the video and follow the instructions below.  

### Join Posit Cloud

You will receive an invitation to join a our online classroom on [Posit Cloud](https://login.posit.cloud/login), where you will need to sign up for an account using your email, or you can connect it to a gmail or GitHub account (any of these choices will work fine for the class). If do you not have a gmail or GitHub account, use your email instead. 

### Class Structure

For all lessons, please follow along in your RStudio cloud session and type + run the same code that I will demonstrate. 

I will record each day's lessons and make it available through email and Canvas and post the notes shortly after class ends. It is important that you read through notes and watch the video if (1) you had to miss some or all of a class or (2) there is material you do not understand. Please use the time between courses to ensure you understand the material. 

**At the end of most lessons this will be included:**

## Putting it all together

Tips designed to weave together information from multiple lessons.

**This will also be posted at the end of all lessons:**

## Learning Goals

This will be a list of what each lesson intended to teach. 

If you do not think you have met those learning goals, please review the notes, rewatch the videos and if the material is still unclear, contact the instructor. 

It's very important you understand the learning goals of each lesson before moving on to the next.
