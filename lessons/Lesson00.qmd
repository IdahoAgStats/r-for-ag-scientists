title: "Preparing for this Class"

Welcome & salutations!

I excited to teach this course. I have fully revamped this curriculum, doing my best to recreate "beginner's mind". 

We have very limited time, so order to conserve class time and have us all ready for the first day of class, please read through this "Lesson Zero", watch the video and follow the instructions below.  

#### <<< *video coming soon!* >>>

### Join Posit Cloud

You will receive an invitation to join a our online classroom on [Posit Cloud](https://login.posit.cloud/login), where you will need to sign up for an account using your email, or you can connect it to a Gmail or GitHub account (any of these choices will work fine for the class). If do you not have a Gmail or GitHub account, use your normal email instead. If you are taking this for course credit, please use your official UI email. 

### Class Structure

For all lessons, please follow along in your RStudio cloud session. In most instances, you will type and run the same code that I will demonstrate.

I will record each day's lessons and make it available through email and Canvas. Additionally, all code generated that day will be posted on this course website shortly after each class ends. It is important that you read through notes and watch the video if (1) you had to miss some or all of a class, or (2) there is material you do not understand. 

**It is very important that you use the time between class sessions to ensure you understand the material.**

### Class Notes Structure 

As mentioned, all code run will be captured in class notes that will be posted. While you can read those notes and not attend class, many find it helpful to attend a live course and receive live instruction and feedback from an expert. Additionally, those of you formally registered for **BCB 502** are required to attend at least 60% of the classes per the [syllabus](../syllabus.qmd) in order to pass. 

**At the beginning of each lesson, this box will be included:**

## Learning Goals

This will be a list of what each lesson intends to teach. 

If you do not think you have met those learning goals, please review the notes, rewatch the videos and if the material is still unclear, contact me.

**At the end of most lessons, this box will be included:**

## Putting it all together

Tips designed to weave together information from multiple lessons.

### How to Suceed in Learning R

- At the end of each class, review the learning goals and decide if you met those goals. These are designed to be the bare minimum of knowledge to competently use R. Later workshop/course content builds on this knowledge.  
- Review what we have covered between classes - refresh your knowledge. 
- If there are practice problems, do them. 
- Experiment in the R console using what you learned. Really, nothing can go wrong. 
- If class material is not clear, re-run the code from class and reread the notes; watch the videos. If it's still not clear, contact me. 
- Come to me with specific questions! Iâ€™m here to help. 

### Your very first R lesson!

* R is case-sensitive! (`data` is different from `Data` and `DATA`). This means when typing commands, exercise great care and attention to detail so your code works. 
* There is no "undo" button in R. Once a command is run, you can't undo it! (this is not as bad as it sounds)
