title: "Preparing for this Class"

Welcome & salutations!

I excited to teach this course. I have fully revamped this curriculum, doing my best to recreate "beginner's mind". 

We have very limited time, so order to conserve class time and have us all ready for the first day of class, please read through this "Lesson Zero", watch the video and follow the instructions below.

### Join Posit Cloud

You will receive an invitation to join a our online classroom on [Posit Cloud](https://login.posit.cloud/login), where you will need to sign up for an account using your email, or you can connect it to a gmail or GitHub account (any of these choices will work fine for the class). If do you not have a gmail or GitHub account, use your email instead. 

### Class Structure

For all lessons, please follow along in your RStudio cloud session and type + run the same code that I will demonstrate. 

I will record each day's lessons and make it available through email and Canvas. Additionally, all code generated that day will be posted on this course website shortly after each class ends. It is important that you read through notes and watch the video if (1) you had to miss some or all of a class, or (2) there is material you do not understand. **It is very important that you use the time between courses to ensure you understand the material.**

### Class Notes Structure: 

As mentioned, all code run will be captured in class notes that will be posted. While you can read those notes and not attend class, many find it helpful to attend a live course and receive live instruction and feedback from an expert. Additionally, those of you formally registered for **BCB 503** are required to attend at least 60% of the classes per the [syllabus](../syllabus.qmd) in order to pass. 



**At the beginning of each lesson, this box will be included:**

## Learning Goals

This will be a list of what each lesson intended to teach. 

If you do not think you have met those learning goals, please review the notes, rewatch the videos and if the material is still unclear, contact the instructor. 

It's very important you understand the learning goals of each lesson before moving on to the next.

## Putting it all together

Tips designed to weave together information from multiple lessons.

### Your very first R lesson!

* R is case-sensitive! ("data" is different from "Data" and "DATA")
* Once a command is run, you can't undo it! (this is not as bad as it sounds)
