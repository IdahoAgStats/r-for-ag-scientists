The package <strong><em><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a></em></strong> is also loaded since we will need to use some of their functions to prepare the data for plots.</p>
<p>The data set, “nass.hay” is from the <strong><em><a href="https://kwstat.github.io/agridat/">agridat</a></em></strong> package. It is historic data on hay production across U.S. states from 1909 to 2012 gathered by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. This script also creates a data object only containing data from Idaho, and a data object with hay production stats from 2012.</p>

<li>ggplot2 uses the <code>+</code> notation in their plots (see below). It’s my understanding that there is some regret over this style decision by the ggplot authors, but it is now an accepted convention.</li>
<li>ggplot2 also uses non-standard evaluation, so, often column names do not need to be quoted<br>

<li>x (the x variable)<br>

<p>In this plot, it is hard to see what is going on since the each distribution covers up the one plotted before it (so we can’t really see Idaho, but Washington’s hay yield distribution is clear). The attribute “alpha” can be used to add a transparency to colors. The code is <code>alpha =  n</code> where <code>n</code> is the proportion of the color that is shown (0 is completely transparent and 1 is no transparency).</p>

<p>In this example, it is likely there is over-plotting of data since each state has 104 data point associated with it. The geom <code>geom_jitter()</code> can be used to jiggle overlapping points. Points can be jittered in the vertical and horizontal direction. In this case, jittering in the horizontal direction will result in no change in the interpretation since the y-axis indicates actual value associated with each point.</p>
