## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should:

-   How to install and load packages in R
-   know to import different data types in R
-   understand how to make changes in data set in R
-   Export data in R

### Install and Load Packages

1.  To install packages:

You can either use `install.pcakages()` function

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")   # install 'dplyr' package
```


Or click Tools \> Install packages. Write the package name in dialog,
then click *install*. 

2.  To Load packages:

Once you install the package, you need to load it so that it becomes available to use. Simply use `library()` function.
```{r}
library(dplyr)  # load 'dplyr' package
```


- Installing and loading packages in R - Data
import in r - Data wrangling + data type coercion - Data Export in R
