## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should:

* be able to select columns in R using `select()`
* be able to filter a data set
* know to create new variables using `mutate()`
* be able to rename variables
* be able to sort a data set
* be able to aggregate data and perform actions on those aggregated data
:::

**First, load libraries:**
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr); library(tidyr)
```

**Next, import data:**

```{r}
variety_trials <- read.csv(here::here("data", "trial_data.csv"))
weather <- read.csv(here::here("data", "weather_data.csv"))
```

::: {.callout-note, collapse="true"}

What is going on with `here::here()`?

The `here()` function is from the ***[here](https://here.r-lib.org/)*** package. This package simplifies working directory issues by setting it to where the nearest .Rproj files exists. When using a .qmd file, it looks for the .Rproj file that is the same directory as that file and moves up the directory tree.

### Tidyverse notes

This lesson relies on group of packages called the "Tidyverse", in particular **dplyr** and **tidyr**. 

These packages follow a special set of rules called "non-standard evaluation" (sometimes abbreviated "NSE"). 

All functions in the Tidyverse follow this structure:

```function(dataset, action)```

Where "dataset" is the data framed being input and "action" is whatever action is being taken. 

Tidyverse non-standard evaluation uses quotes far less often than "base R" (base R are package that are installed automatically when R is updated). It also uses indexing `$` less frequently. You can name a variable directly instead of using `dataset$var`.


### Selection columns

The function `select` is used to specify *column* you want to keep (all rows are returned). Columns can be specified by name or position (i.e. the first two columsn in the data set would be `1:2`).

Select by name: 
```{r}
select1 <- select(variety_trials, variety, yield, grain_protein)
head(select1)
```
You can also select on what columns you do *not* want: 
```{r}
select2 <- select(variety_trials, -trial)
select3 <- select(variety_trials, -c(trial, plot))

head(select2); head(select3)
```
:::{.callout-note}
The variables specified in `select()` will appear in the new data frame in exactly the order they were listed in the function call.
:::

Sometimes, you might want to select many columns that share something common about their name:
```{r}
select4 <- select(variety_trials, starts_with("r"))
head(select4)
```
This particular example is not all that useful, but you might have a large data set, with several dozen variables that all start with "snp" followed by some alpha-numeric code (e.g. "snp4738"). This function will enable you to select these column more efficiently than naming every single one. 

There are more options for pattern matching on column names: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?tidyselect::starts_with #another option for searching help from the R console
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "starts_with.png"))
```

### Filtering rows

The function `filter` is used to specify *rows* you want to keep (all columns are returned). This command uses logical operators for deciding what to keep. 
```{r}
filter1 <- filter(variety_trials, variety == "Stephens") # match one name
filter2 <- filter(variety_trials, variety %in% c("Stephens", "Bobtail")) # match multiple names
filter3 <- filter(variety_trials, yield > 50 & grain_protein <= 14) # filter on multiple conditions

dim(filter1); dim(filter2); dim(filter3)
```

::: {.callout-note}

It is also possible to select or filter by numeric position: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
select(variety_trials, c(1:3, 4))
filter(variety_trials, c(1:100, 201:300))
```

While filtering and selecting (but especially filtering) by numeric position works, it is an unreliable choice because it depends on column order or row order being exactly as you expect it. This may work the first time you write + run code, but it is likely to fail over time as you sort, augment or change data sets.

### Creating new variables

You can quite create new variables with a `mutate()` function call:

```
mutate(dataset, var_name = variable)
```
 
Examples: 
```{r}
new_var <- rbinom(n = nrow(variety_trials), size = 1, prob = 0.5)

mutate1 <- mutate(variety_trials, 
                    dataset = "example",
                    row_position = 1:n(),
                    range_new = range,
                    random_yield = yield + rnorm(n = n()),
                    binom_var = new_var, 
                    yield_protein = yield + grain_protein)

table(new_var)
head(mutate1)
```

This created 6 new variables:

- **dateset** which is a character with the value "example" for all rows
- **row_position** providing the row number, starting at 1 and ending at `n()`, a function that returns the total nubmer of rows in the data frame
- **range_new** which is a copy of the variable "range"
- **random_yield** which is the sum of the value for yield plus a random deviation from the function `rnorm`. This operation is vectorized, using the 'yield' measurement for each row and generating a new random deviate for each row. 
- **binom_var** the binomical outcomes variable created in the `new_var ....` statement. 
- **yield_protein** the addition of two variables in the data set (this is also vectorized, calculating this for each row)

These example cover the majority of what you are likely to experience: creating a constant, calculating new variables from existing variables, pulling in an external variables, and so forth. 

This is equivalent to what was taught earlier using "$" notation:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mutate1 <- variety_trials # first, copy the data frame
mutate1$dateset <- "example"
mutate1$row_position <- 1:nrow(mutate1)
mutate1$range_new <- mutate1$range_new # note that NSE cannot be used
mutate1$random_yield <- mutate1$yield + rnorm(nrow(mutate1))
mutate1$binom_var = new_var
mutate1$yield_protein <- mutate1$yield + mutate1$grain_protein
```

This can be a bit longer and cumbersome compared to `mutate` statements, but it does work. 

#### `case_when()` a special type of `mutate`

Occasionally, you will need a define a variable conditionally, based on information from other variables. Here is an example for weather data. Here, a special minimum value is created where all data for "tmin_F" less than 50Â°F are set at 50: 

```{r, eval= FALSE}
weather <- mutate(weather, new_min = case_when(
  tmin_F <= 50 ~ 50,
  TRUE ~ tmin_F))
```

Everything to the left of the tilde `~` is a logical expression to evaluate. Everything to the right of the tilde is the value to put if the logical expression evaluates to TRUE. 

This can easily become more complex! 

If you want to bin continuous data into intervals (e.g. "low", "medium", "high), use the base function `cut()` which can bin data into groups based on equal groups, or specific cut-off values you provide. 

If you have a categorical variable that needs further refinement (e.g. collapsing of multiple levels into one), check out the package [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/), which provides many functions for manipulating categorical (factor or character) variables. 

### Renaming Variables

Compared to `mutate()`, the function for renaming variables, `rename()` is a breeze!

```
rename(dataset, new_name = "old_name")
```
This is similar to variable assignment:
```
new <- old
```
Except that quotes are always used when specifying the old variable name. 

Example: 
```{r}
rename1 <- rename(variety_trials, cultivar = "variety")
head(rename1, 3)
```

Also, you can use `rename` notation in `select` statements:
```{r}
rename2 <- select(variety_trials, cultivar = "variety", yield, protein = "grain_protein")
```

This function selected the columns "variety", "yield" and "grain_protein", while renaming "variety to "cultivar" and "grain_protein" to "protein". A handy shortcut!

### Split up variables

You may encounter variables with information about multiple things. In agriculture, I see variables like "Moscow_2021", "Moscow_2022", "StJohn_2021", "StJohn_2022" which is communicating a data set collected in different locations (Moscow and St. John) in different years (2021 and 2022). This is a useful variable, but we might want to separate out location and year. The ***tidyr*** function `separate()` can do that.

The first column of "variety_trials" contains considerable information, all separated by an underscore: 

```{r}
variety_trials$trial[1]
```

The first term is the program conducting the trial, the second is the crop grown, the third term is a location code, and the last term is the year. Let's separate those terms into separate columns/variables.

These terms use an underscore to separate them, which we will use in the function. However, one of the term does have an underscore inside of it, which will interpreted incorrectly as a term separator. 

```{r}
variety_trials$trial
```

```{r}
variety_trials$trial <- gsub(pattern = "_H_", replacement = "_H-", x = variety_trials$trial )
```

```{r}
variety_trials <- separate(variety_trials, trial, 
                           into = c("program", "crop", "location", "year"),
                           sep = "_", 
                           remove = FALSE)
```
 
The argument `remove = FALSE` indicates that we want to keep the input variable ("trial"). By default, it would be removed. 

The opposite function is `tidyr::unite()` which will paste these variable together, separate by any character string you specify. `unite()` also can ignore missing data when pasting information together, avoiding this unfortunate result: "somevar_NA_NA_anothervar". You would get "somevar_anothervar" instead.

### Sorting a data set

Prior to dplyr, sorting in R was a nightmare. Excel makes this so easy! Why was R torturing us??? But, dplyr has made this much easier:

```
arrange(dataset, variable1, variable2, ....)
```
You can sort on as many variables as you like! It will sort on the first variables listed and within that, the second variable listed, and so on.

Example; 
```{r}
arrange1 <- arrange(variety_trials, variety, yield)
```

#### Output file

Let's output this object to file so we can use it later.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write.csv(variety_trials, here::here("outputs", "variety_trials_clean.csv"), row.names = FALSE)
```


### The pipe 

The pipe operator `%>%` or its newer replacement `|>` are magic, or at least, they make our (data wrangling) lives so much easier.

The pipe operator works as thus:
```
operation_1 %>% operation_2
```

One operation can be performed (e.g. a `select()` command), and that resulting data frame is passed on to the next operation (e.g. `filter()`).

Example: filter then sort
```{r}
pipe1 <- filter(variety_trials, yield < 75) %>% arrange(variety)
```

The data set is not named in the second operation because it is assumed to be dataset provided in the first operation. Whatever is being output directly left of the pipe operator is in the input data set. 

We can take this even further by making the first operation our addition of the data set to the pipes: 

```{r}
pipe2 <- variety_trials %>% filter(yield < 75) %>% arrange(variety)
```

The pipe has made data wrangling so much easier! Before the pipe, each of these operations can be specified separately with its own object. So when you were done, you had roughly 50 objects in your environment, 48 of which were not needed anymore. 

It also saved us from the "parentheses cascade" where you nest operations within another and no longer had any sense of which set of parentheses belong to which operation.

```{r, echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "nest_vs_pipe.jpg"))
```

## Putting it all together

What going on this notation?
```
tibble::rownames_to_column()
```

This is a normal function call (the function being `rownames_to_column()`), and it is specifying that the package where this function resides is [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tibble-package.html) (a tibble is the Tidyverse alternative to the data frame). 

You want to use this notation in 2 circumstance:

- You don't want to load the entire package with a `library()` call, especially if you only need one function from it

- The name of the function you want to call from a package conflicts with function names from another package. A very common example is `filter()` - this is a dplyr function, but it is also a base R function. Sometimes, you may receive a very puzzling error when using `filter()` that essentially is indicating that the wrong package was used. Using notation like `dplyr::filter()` clarified to R that you want to use the dplyr version of `filter()`. By default, the most recent package loaded overrides other function name conflicts, but sometiimes, it's helpful to be unambiguous in your R function calls.
