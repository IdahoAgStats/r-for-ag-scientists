<p>We will load <strong><em>ggplot2</em></strong>, which will automatically load a useful package of color palette, ‘RColorBrewer’. The packages ‘dplyr’, ‘forcats’ and ‘data.table’ are loaded since we will need to use some of their functions to prepare the data for plots.</p>
<p>The data set, “nass.hay” is from the <strong><em>agridat</em></strong> package. It is historic data on hay production across U.S. states from 1909 to 2012 gathered by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. This script also creates a data object only containing data from Idaho, and a data object with hay production stats from 2012.</p>

<p>In this plot, it is hard to see what is going on since the each distribution covers up the one plotted before it (so we can’t really see Idaho, but Washington’s hay yield distribution is clear). The attribute “alpha” can be used to add a transparency to colors. The code is <code>alpha =  n</code> where <code>n</code> is the proportion of the color that is shown (0 is completely transparent and 1 is no transparency).</p>

<p>Geoms are best thought of as plotting layers. Additional geoms can be added to a single plot, adding additional layers of information. Each geom is added to the plot in the order it is specified in the ggplot statement.</p>
<p>Adding an overall of points over boxplots is a good way to summarise the empirical distribution of a large number of data points:</p>

<p>In this example, it is likely there is over-plotting of data since each state has 104 data point associated with it. The geom <code>geom_jitter()</code> can be used to jiggle overlapping points. Points can be jittered in the vertical and horizontal direction. In this case, jittering in the horizontal direction will result in no change in the interpretation since the y-axis indicates actual value associated with each point.</p>
