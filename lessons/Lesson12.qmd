## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should: 

* Be able to export data from R
:::

This is a very short lesson because exporting data is quite similar to importing data. 

This lesson is focused on exporting tabular data. 

### `write.csv()`


### `write.table()`

### `write.delim()`


### `save()`

This is special option to save objects in your environment to file. These can only be used by R, but are convenient if you plan to return to these object:

Save one object: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
save(object1)
save(object1, object2)
```

Save multiple objects: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
save(object1, file = "mydata.RData")
save(object1, object2, object3,...)
```
