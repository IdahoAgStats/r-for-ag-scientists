*(for the data wrangling lesson)*

*If you have your own data, import it and consider what sort of data wrangling you might need to do on the data set to ready it for analysis - does something need to be filtered or calculated? This is a good moment to apply skills learned. *

(@) Import "trial_metadata.csv" with the [***readr***](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) function `read_csv()`. Create a new variable that combined information in the 'location' and 'irrigation' columns.

(@) Filter the imported data set for when the location is "Parma" and sort the data set based on planting date. Assign the results to a new object.

*Note: we have not yet learned how to sort, so you can either skip that step or look up the documentation for `arrange()`, the dplyr function for sorting.* 

(@) Select 4 columns from the data set and rename one of them. Assign these results to a new object. 

(@) Import "weather_data.csv", select the first five columns and reduce that data set to unique rows (look into using `distinct()` for extracting the unique observations). 

(@) NEW: Import "trial_data.csv". Split the "trials" column into 4 variables as we did in class (or see the lesson notes). Filter the data set to the 2 most recent years and the varieties WA8268, WB4418, WB4311, WB4623CLP, WB4792, and WB7589


(@) Output the result from any of the previous problems to file.
