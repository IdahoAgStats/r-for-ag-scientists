(@) First load the libraries. 
 
 ```{r}
 library(readr); library(dplyr); library(tidyr)
 ```

 Then, import the data and create the new variable. 

 ```{r}
mydata <- read_csv(here::here("data", "trial_metadata"))) %>%
    unite("new_var", location, irrigation, sep = "_", remove = FALSE ))
 ```

 Another option:

 ```{r}
mydata$new_var <- paste(location, irrigation, sep = "_")
 ```

 Another option: 

 ```{r}
mydata <- mydata %>% mutate(new_var = paste(location, irrigation, sep = "_")))
 ```

(@) Filter and sort:

```{r}
mydata_filtered <- mydata %>% filter(location == "Parma") %>% arrange(planting_date)
```

(@) Select and rename

```{r}
mydata_selected <- mydata %>% select(trial, grower_cooperator, location, year) %>%
    rename(farm = "grower_cooperator")
```

Or in one step:

```{r}
mydata_selected <- mtdata %>% select(trial, farm = "grower_cooperator, location, year)
```
