(@) Import "caribbean_maize.csv" with the function `read_csv()` and assigns it to an object named "data2". 

(@) Create the vector names 'plot', 'ears', and 'site' by extracting these variables from data2.

(@) What is the data type of these vectors?

(@) Convert 'plot' into factor. Inspect the results. What happened? 

(@) Create a new vector (M1) as a product of addition of 100 to 'ears'. 

(@) Make a data frame (data3) consisting of 'plot', 'ears', and 'isle' using `data.frame()` function and look at the structure of the data.

(@) Extract the values located in the first 2 rows and third column of data3.
