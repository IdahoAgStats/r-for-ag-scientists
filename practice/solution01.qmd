$$ \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$$

$\pi$ = 3.14
$e$ = 2.718
$\mu$ = 50
$\sigma$ = 5
$x$ = 20

1. For this problem, there are several possible solutions:

* Manual the whole way down:

```{r}
1/(5*(2*3.14)^0.5)*2.718^(-0.5*((20-50)/5)^2)
```

* Employing a few shortcuts

```{r}
1/(5*sqrt(2*pi))*exp(-0.5*((20-50)/5)^2)
```

*  R function that estimates the [standard normal density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) (the equation above is the probability density function for the normal distribution)

```{r}
dnorm(x = 20, mean = 50, sd = 5)
```


::: callout-note
It's not expected you would be aware of the second and third solutions given what has been taught thus far, but it's helpful to be aware that many shortcuts exist in R to make coding easier.

2. Using the manual approach:

```{r}
x = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
1/(5*(2*3.14)^0.5)*2.718^(-0.5*((x-50)/5)^2)
```
