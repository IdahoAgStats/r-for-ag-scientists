(from introduction to R types and objects lesson)

1. You have this collection of items:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(-2:3, TRUE, FALSE, 1L, 0L, "zero"). 
```
What data type is this? 

1. Convert this object to these types:
  * logical
  * numeric
  * character
Inspect the results. What happened? 

1. Make a vector of letters "a" to "m" (all lowercase) and letters "N" to "Z" (all uppercase).

1. Make a vector of numbers 1 to 10 and 2 to 50. 

1. Make a data frame consisting of 6 rows and 4 columns, where one is a character variable, another is numberic, another is logical and the another is a factor. Verify that each column type is what you intended it to be. 

1. Put all your vectors and the data frame into a list. For the first list item that has a vector, change the forth item of that vector to missing.

1. For the list created in the previous problem, delete the second item.

## Hint
* the functions `letters()` and `LETTERS()` provide a shortcut for problem #3. 
* try using `NULL` for the last problem.
