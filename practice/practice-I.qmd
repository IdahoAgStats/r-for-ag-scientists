*(for the data merging lesson)*

(@) Download [genotypic_data_rotated.csv](https://github.com/IdahoAgStats/r-for-ag-scientists/raw/main/data/genotypic_data_rotated.csv) (see script below), Import that file, along with, "trial_data.csv", and "trial_metadata.csv". 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
download.file(url = "https://github.com/IdahoAgStats/r-for-ag-scientists/raw/main/data/genotypic_data_rotated.csv",
              destfile = here::here("data", "genotypic_data_rotated.csv"))
```

(@) Do an inner join between "genotypic_data_rotated.csv" and "trial_data.csv" using variety names. 

(@) Do a semi-join of "genotypic_data_rotated.csv" with "trial_data.csv" and do the reverse. How does this compare with the inner join from the previous problem? 

(@) Do an anti-join between "genotypic_data_rotated.csv" and "trial_data.csv". 

(@) Join together all common observations between the 3 files (your choice on join).
