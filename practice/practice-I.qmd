*(for the data merging lesson)*

(@) Import "genotypic_data_rotated.txt", "trial_data.csv", and "trial_metadata.csv"). 

(@) Do a full join between "trial_data" and "trial_metadata". 

(@) Do an inner join between "genotypic_data_rotated.txt" and "trial_data.csv"). 

(@) Do a semi-join of "genotypic_data_rotated" with "trial_data" and do the reverse. How does this compare with the inner join from the previous problem? 

(@) Do an anti-join between genotypic_data_rotated and trial_data. 

(@) Join together all common observations (by variety name) between the 3 files.
