*(for the data import lesson)*

1. Import one of your data sets using two of the functions taught:

(save your data in different format to enable this)

* `read.csv()`
* `read_csv()`
* `read_excel()`
* `read.delim()`

1. Examine the data imported using `View(imported_data)`. Did everything import as expected? Are your variables coded as they should be? Are numeric variables numeric? Are missing data detected as thus?
