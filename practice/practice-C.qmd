(for lessons on data structures)

1. You have this object in your R session: `x = 7`. What is the difference between `x[1]` and `x`? 

1. You have this list: `mylist = list(x1 = "snow", x2 = 45:65, x3 = rep(letters[1:3], each = 3), x4 = matrix(1:100, nrow = 10))`. Return this list without x3. 

1. You have this data frame:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(one = 1:10,
                 two = rnorm(10))
df$three <- df$two + rnorm(10)
df$four <- sample(c("A", "B"), 10, replace = TRUE)
```

* Add another column, 'five', that is a character variable consisting of levels that are fruits of your choice. 
* Add another column, 'six' that is actually 'five' coerced into a factor 
* Make a new data frame with the columns in this order: five, one, four, two, three


1. You have this object in R session: `m100 = matrix(1:100, ncol = 20, nrow = 5)`. What do you do if you want all the rows from this matrix, but only values 1:50? 

1. What happens if you don't have enough values to make a completed filled matrix (e.g. you have 99 observations rather than 100)?
