:::Pre-survey:::

What is your current R programming knowledge? 
- nothing
- not nothing

Are your data....
(or will your data...)
(check all that apply)

- from research experiments you are conducting or have conducted?
- from lab work you are doing? 
- from simulation?
- generated by someone else?
- in tabular form?
- include shapefiles?
- include any image data?
- from web scraping?
- from a third party database (e.g. Federal databases, NCBI)?
- requires some level of data cleaning and preparing prior to usage? 
- spread out across several files
- relying on formatting to communicate information (e.g. yellow cells mean the data are suspect)

What do want to do in R once you become a competent R user?
