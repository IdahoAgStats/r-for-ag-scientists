### Prerequesites

This course is intended for beginner R users. No previous experience in R or any other programming/statistical language is expected (although previous R users whose skills have lapsed are welcomed!)

### Course requirements

Computer with a stable internet connection. A camera and microphone for Zoom.

### Grades policy

This is a pass/fail class that is largely participation driven. Your 'grade' will be a direct reflection of your attendance and participation during class. Attendance of 5 classes, or 62.% of the total instruction time will constitute a passing grade. Participating means attending and following along with the coding demonstration on your own computer. 

Some of you have already communicated with me regarding time you will miss due to scheduling conflicts. Your time away will not count against your grade, but, please be sure to watch the videos and read the notes for the class time you miss.
