    "text": "University of Idaho Carpentries is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants of the conference regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion (or lack thereof).\nWe encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and thus require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. An inclusive space free of harassment encourages interaction among diverse groups. We want to make certain our workshops and courses are welcoming, and encourages participants to be involved moving forward.\nAll participants (including organizers, attendees, instructors and volunteers) at UI Carpentries Workshops are required to agree to the following code of conduct. Reports of violation to this Code of Conduct should be addressed to the course/workshop lead instructor.\nThis Code of Conduct (CoC) applies to any participant in a University of Idaho Carpentries Workshop. Note that this code augments rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.\n\nExpected Behavior\nAll workshop/course participants are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, with both this Code of Conduct as well as their respective employer’s policies governing appropriate workplace behavior, and all applicable laws.\nWe’re committed to providing welcome environments where people behave according to professional standards. We expect everyone at any UI Carpentries-affiliated event to contribute to a welcoming, civil, safe, and tolerant environment.\nExamples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:\n\nUsing welcoming and inclusive language\nBeing respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accepting constructive criticism\nFocusing on what is best for everyone at the event\nShowing empathy towards other participants\n\n\n\nUnacceptable Behavior\nHarassment will not be tolerated in any form, including but not limited to:\n\nIntimidation or harassment of any kind.\nOffensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held.\nUnwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.\nDeliberate misgendering, “outing,” or use of “dead” or rejected names.\nGratuitous or off-topic blatant sexual images or behavior in spaces where they are not appropriate.\nNot respecting the privacy of other participants\n\n\n\nHarassment in online channels\nSome of our workshops are online event. Please use these guidelines when engaging with participants. The above Code of Conduct applies to an online event, with the addition of:\n\nAvoid using overtly sexual or offensive usernames or profile photos which might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.\nDo not publish text/screenshots of anything shared in private communication channels without explicit consent from the author. This includes screenshots of private messages to public channels, as well as conversations on public channels to anywhere outside of UI Carpentries Workshop.\nDo not direct message someone without their permission.\nDo not record sessions without the presenter’s permission.\nThe meeting host/organizer should be aware of privacy concerns for different tools. For tips on security, a good place to start is: Securing Your Zoom Meetings.\n\nThis CoC applies to all University of Idaho Carpentries online spaces.\n\n\nResponses to Code of Conduct Violations\nWe will follow all University of Idaho and Idaho State requirements regarding how to handle incidents of harassment.\n\n\nWhat To Do If You Witness or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns relating to harassment, please contact the lead instructor immediately.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis CoC is adapted from RConsortium CoC and the Carpentries CoC This policy is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license."

    "text": "Welcome & salutations!\nI excited to teach this course. I have fully revamped this curriculum, doing my best to recreate “beginner’s mind”.\nWe have very limited time, so order to conserve class time and have us all ready for the first day of class, please read through this “Lesson Zero”, watch the video and follow the instructions below.\n\n<<< video coming soon! >>>\n\n\nJoin Posit Cloud\nYou will receive an invitation to join a our online classroom on Posit Cloud, where you will need to sign up for an account using your email, or you can connect it to a Gmail or GitHub account (any of these choices will work fine for the class). If do you not have a Gmail or GitHub account, use your normal email instead. If you are taking this for course credit, please use your official UI email.\n\n\nClass Structure\nFor all lessons, please follow along in your RStudio cloud session. In most instances, you will type and run the same code that I will demonstrate.\nI will record each day’s lessons and make it available through email and Canvas. Additionally, all code generated that day will be posted on this course website shortly after each class ends. It is important that you read through notes and watch the video if (1) you had to miss some or all of a class, or (2) there is material you do not understand.\nIt is very important that you use the time between class sessions to ensure you understand the material.\n\n\nClass Notes Structure\nAs mentioned, all code run will be captured in class notes that will be posted. While you can read those notes and not attend class, many find it helpful to attend a live course and receive live instruction and feedback from an expert. Additionally, those of you formally registered for BCB 502 are required to attend at least 60% of the classes per the syllabus in order to pass.\nAt the beginning of each lesson, this box will be included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Goals\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be a list of what each lesson intends to teach.\nIf you do not think you have met those learning goals, please review the notes, rewatch the videos and if the material is still unclear, contact me.\n\n\n\nAt the end of most lessons, this box will be included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nTips designed to weave together information from multiple lessons.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Suceed in Learning R\n\nAt the end of each class, review the learning goals and decide if you met those goals. These are designed to be the bare minimum of knowledge to competently use R. Later workshop/course content builds on this knowledge.\n\nReview what we have covered between classes - refresh your knowledge.\nIf there are practice problems, do them.\nExperiment in the R console using what you learned. Really, nothing can go wrong.\nIf class material is not clear, re-run the code from class and reread the notes; watch the videos. If it’s still not clear, contact me.\nCome to me with specific questions! I’m here to help.\n\n\n\nYour very first R lesson!\n\nR is case-sensitive! (data is different from Data and DATA). This means when typing commands, exercise great care and attention to detail so your code works.\nThere is no “undo” button in R. Once a command is run, you can’t undo it! (this is not as bad as it sounds)"

    "text": "If you made this far, congratulations! Learning any programming language takes a big effort.\nThis is only the beginning. You will probably need more R knowledge, both generalized and specialized, to accomplish your research goals. Here are a few resources to develop stronger data science skills in R.\n\nData Science in a Box is a online course by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel with videos for further development of R skills.\nR 4 Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund is a comprehensive book providing guidance on leveraging R for data science aims\nWhat They Forgot to Teach you about R (and workshop version) describes some meta processes for ensuring a repeatable workflow.\n\nThere are many other resources to help develop skills in genetics, bioinformatics, geospatial analysis, Bayesian statistics, ….you name it. Look for the resources that will help you develop skills in R. One very reliable place to start are CRAN Task Views which provide a list of packages and other relevant R resources specific for a given topic such as environmetrics (ecology), spatial tools and agriculture.\nAnother good source for keeping up with major developments in R, contributed R packages and other R resources is R Weekly which puts out a weekly blog post (also available in a weekly podcast and an RSS feed)."

Attendance and participation of 5 classes, or 62.5% of the total instruction time, will constitute a passing grade. Participating means attending and following along with the coding demonstration on your own computer.\nSome of you have already communicated with me regarding time you will miss due to scheduling conflicts with other courses. Your time away will not count against your attendance record and final grade. Please be sure to watch the videos and read the notes for the class time you miss so you do not fall behind in the course content."
