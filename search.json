An inclusive space free of harassment encourages interaction among diverse groups. We want to make certain our workshops and courses are welcoming, and encourages participants to be involved moving forward.\nAll participants (including organizers, attendees, instructors and volunteers) at UI Carpentries Workshops are required to agree to the following code of conduct. Reports of violation to this Code of Conduct should be addressed to the course/workshop lead instructor.\nThis Code of Conduct (CoC) applies to any participant in a University of Idaho Carpentries Workshop. Note that this code augments rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.\n\nExpected Behavior\nAll workshop/course participants are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, with both this Code of Conduct as well as their respective employer’s policies governing appropriate workplace behavior, and all applicable laws.\nWe’re committed to providing welcome environments where people behave according to professional standards. We expect everyone at any UI Carpentries-affiliated event to contribute to a welcoming, civil, safe, and tolerant environment.\nExamples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:\n\nUsing welcoming and inclusive language\nBeing respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accepting constructive criticism\nFocusing on what is best for everyone at the event\nShowing empathy towards other participants\n\n\n\nUnacceptable Behavior\nHarassment will not be tolerated in any form, including but not limited to:\n\nIntimidation or harassment of any kind.\nOffensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held.\nUnwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.\nDeliberate misgendering, “outing,” or use of “dead” or rejected names.\nGratuitous or off-topic blatant sexual images or behavior in spaces where they are not appropriate.\nNot respecting the privacy of other participants\n\n\n\nHarassment in online channels\nSome of our workshops are online event. Please use these guidelines when engaging with participants. The above Code of Conduct applies to an online event, with the addition of:\n\nAvoid using overtly sexual or offensive usernames or profile photos which might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.\nDo not publish text/screenshots of anything shared in private communication channels without explicit consent from the author. This includes screenshots of private messages to public channels, as well as conversations on public channels to anywhere outside of UI Carpentries Workshop.\nDo not direct message someone without their permission.\nDo not record sessions without the presenter’s permission.\nThe meeting host/organizer should be aware of privacy concerns for different tools. For tips on security, a good place to start is: Securing Your Zoom Meetings.\n\nThis CoC applies to all University of Idaho Carpentries online spaces.\n\n\nResponses to Code of Conduct Violations\nWe will follow all University of Idaho and Idaho State requirements regarding how to handle incidents of harassment.\n\n\nWhat To Do If You Witness or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns relating to harassment, please contact the lead instructor immediately.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis CoC is adapted from RConsortium CoC and the Carpentries CoC This policy is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license."

It’s a nice tool for putting together reports or doing analysis for yourself. Quarto also has applications for building websites (this website is build with Quarto!), formatting books, and making slideshow presentations. These are advanced applications that over time, you may want to try out yourself.\nIt follows some of the standard syntax of markdown, which is a highly simplified version of HTML (“hypertext markup language”).\nA .qmd document can simply exist as is (and is highly useful), or you can choose to output it to many enabled formats such as .html (the easiest!), .pdf, .docx and more.\nThere is a rich array of possibilities for quarto documents, the majority of which we will not addres in this class. Take a look at this gallery to get a better sense of what you can do with quarto and decide for yourself if it’s worth the effor to learn better.\nI started learning standard documents, then made a few presentations with quarto (I’m not sure this is worth the effort), and run many many website with quarto and/or its predecessor, Rmarkdown (this has been great!)."

I have fully revamped this curriculum, doing my best to recreate “beginner’s mind”.\nWe have very limited time, so order to conserve class time and have us all ready for the first day of class, please read through this “Lesson Zero”, watch the video and follow the instructions below.\n\n\nJoin Posit Cloud\nYou will receive an invitation a link via email from us to join our online classroom on Posit Cloud, where you will need to sign up for an account using your email, or you can connect it to a Gmail or GitHub account (any of these choices will work fine for the class). If do you not have a Gmail or GitHub account, use your normal email instead. If you are taking this for course credit, please use your official UI email. Once you receive the invitation and have created an account, follow these instructions for accessing the classroom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant!!!\n\n\n\nIf you use any other email for your Posit account than the one associated with your UI account, please notify me ASAP so I can invite you to join the classroom.\n\n\n\n\nClass Structure\nFor all lessons, please follow along in your RStudio cloud session. In most instances, you will type and run the same code that I will demonstrate.\nI will record each day’s lessons and make it available through email and Canvas. Additionally, all code generated that day will be posted on this course website shortly after each class ends. It is important that you read through notes and watch the video if (1) you had to miss some or all of a class, or (2) there is material you do not understand.\nIt is very important that you use the time between class sessions to ensure you understand the material.\n\n\nClass absences\nIt’s okay to miss classes - we all have stuff going on. There is no need to tell me in advance. As mentioned above, if you miss class, please be sure to catch up on the course material you missed by reading the course notes, running the content and watching the video. If you are registered for course credit and will miss more than 3 classes, consider switching to the workshop mode, which is the same content, but no course credit.\n\n\nClass Notes Structure\nAs mentioned, all code run will be captured in class notes that will be posted. While you can read those notes and not attend class, many find it helpful to attend a live course and receive live instruction and feedback from an expert. Additionally, those of you formally registered for BCB 502 are required to attend at least 60% of the classes per the syllabus in order to pass.\nAt the beginning of each lesson, this box will be included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Goals\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be a list of what each lesson intends to teach.\nIf you do not think you have met those learning goals, please review the notes, rewatch the videos and if the material is still unclear, contact me.\n\n\n\nAt the end of most lessons, this box will be included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nTips designed to weave together information from multiple lessons.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Suceed in Learning R\n\nAt the end of each class, review the learning goals and decide if you met those goals. These are designed to be the bare minimum of knowledge to competently use R. Later workshop/course content builds on this knowledge.\n\nReview what we have covered between classes - refresh your knowledge.\nIf there are practice problems, do them.\nExperiment in the R console using what you learned. Really, nothing can go wrong.\nIf class material is not clear, re-run the code from class and reread the notes; watch the videos. If it’s still not clear, contact me.\nCome to me with specific questions! I’m here to help.\n\n\n\nYour very first R lesson!\n\nR is case-sensitive! (data is different from Data and DATA). This means when typing commands, exercise great care and attention to detail so your code works.\nThere is no “undo” button in R. Once a command is run, you can’t undo it! (this is not as bad as it sounds)"

We can create a sequence of numbers by wrapping them all in c() command (for “concatenate”) and separating each with a comma.\n\nc(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)\n\n [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\n\nThen those numbers can be operated on by any math operator:\n\nc(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20) * 10 - 1\n\n [1]  99 109 119 129 139 149 159 169 179 189 199\n\n\nThere’s also a quicker way to specify a sequence of integers using the notation start:end:\n\n1:10\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nIt also counts down:\n\n20:10\n\n [1] 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10\n\n\nAnd works with negative integers:\n\n-5:5\n\n [1] -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5\n\n\nThese can be operated on:\n\n(-5:5)^2\n\n [1] 25 16  9  4  1  0  1  4  9 16 25\n\n\n\n\nObject assignment\nIt is rather cumbersome to continually retype numbers, even while using a shortcut. There’s a general rule of “DRY” when coding, which means “Don’t repeat yourself”. We can avoid this by assigning these numbers to an R object.\nTraditionally, the left arrow is used for object assignment, <- (less than symbol + a dash), but the standard equals sign, = also works. These are equivalent:\n\nx <- 1\nx = 1\n\nWe can assign multiple numbers to an object\n\nx_vector <- 1:10\ny_vector <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n\nThe left arrow assignment <- takes everything on the right side of the arrow and assigns it the object name on the left.\n\n\nObject naming\nIt is your choice (mostly) about what to name R objects. There are a few rules to follow:\n\nspaces are generally not allowed and a huge pain - avoid at all costs!\nDon’t start with a number or symbol! (this is technically possible, but a huge pain)\nchoose a name that is short, yet descriptive\nR is case sensitive, so test is different from Test and TEST. Be mindful of this! It trips many folks up.\n\nIt’s possible that you will thank yourself for using lowercase and avoiding special symbols (aside from . and _)\nif you start a function name with a “.” (e.g. .variable), you won’t see it listed in the global environment (which can be frustrating), this is not recommended for newer R users\nyou cannot use “reserved words” from the R language (terms set aside for very specific purposes in R). When typing these in an R console, they usually light up in a special colors.\n\nHere is some discussion on object naming in R.\n\n\nReserved words\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreserved word\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\nTRUE FALSE\nlogical\n\n\nNA\nmissing value\n\n\nNaN\nnot a number/undefined\n\n\nNULL\nno value/undefined\n\n\nInf -Inf\ninfinity\n\n\nfor in\nfor loops\n\n\nif else while break next repeat\ncontrol flow\n\n\nNA_integer_ NA_real_ NA_complex_ NA_character_\nmissing data by data type\n\n\n\nIt’s easy to forgot these. Run ?reserved in an R console or check here to remind yourself if need be.\nSome examples of reserved words in the wild:\n\nlog(0)\n\n[1] -Inf\n\n0/0\n\n[1] NaN\n\n2/0\n\n[1] Inf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nCheck the environment pane.

    "text": "Learning Goals\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of this lesson, you should:\n\nUnderstand what object class means and how to determine and object’s class\nUnderstand the difference between the 5 main object classes: logical, integer, numeric, character and factors.\nknow how to coerce objects from one class to another\n\n\n\n\nR is a programming language and like all programming languages, it has special conventions for defining how information is classified on your computer and what types of actions can be performed on different data types.\nMuch of this is related to your computer hardware, how computer memory is allocated for R objects and processes and so forth. You don’t need to understand the guts of this to use R (but should you ever want to learn, this is fascinating material).\nThe most common object types and the rules that govern them are described in this lesson.\n\nData types\n\nNumeric\nPreviously, we created an object in R that was a collection or sequence of numbers.\n\nx1 <- 1:10\n\nThese numbers are technically integers (sometimes called “long integers”). We can also create “floating point numbers” (e.g. with precision past the decimal point):\n\nx2 <- c(1.25, 2.718, 10.000)\n\nThese are also called “double precision numbers” or “double” for short.\n\n\nCharacter\nThese can also be created for character variables:\n\nx3 <- \"apple\"\nx4 <- c(\"orange\", \"banana\")\n\nCheck the type for each R object\n\n class(x1)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n class(x2)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n class(x3)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n class(x4)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can force a number to be a integer by adding an L to a number as long as it does not contain a decimal pont (e.g. c(0L, 1L, 2L))\n\n\nThere are two other special classes:\n\n\nLogical\n\nconsisting of TRUE and FALSE values\n\n\nx5 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)\nclass(x5)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n\nObject type coercion\n\nR will automatically an assign an object type based on the items present within object. It will try to assign the simplest type possible. Here are the types from simplest to most complex:\n\n\\[logical < integer < numeric < character\\]\nWhat classes do you think results from each of these?\n\nx8 <- c(8, 9.2)\nx9 <- c(0, 0, 0, 0)\nx10 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, 1, 0)\nx11 <- c(1, 2, \"pear\", -6:2, TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass(x8)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(x9)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(x10)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(x11)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you start importing data, you may notice variables did not come in as expected. This is due to the values in the original data file. For example, there may be a column that is only supposed to contain numeric values, yet it imported as character. The column in the file may contain something like this:\n\nc(1.3, 8, 23, \"0 (dropped sample)\", 100, 84)\n\n[1] \"1.3\"                \"8\"                  \"23\"                \n[4] \"0 (dropped sample)\" \"100\"                \"84\"                \n\n\nThis would import as character because of that one single value that is not numeric!\nYou can check if items are classified as specific types:\n\nis.numeric(x10)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis.logical(x10)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis.logical(x5)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis.character(x4)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nObjects can be coerced with these functions:\n\nas.character(x8)\nas.logical(x10)\nas.numeric(x11)\n\n\n\nSpecial object type: The Factor\nThis is a very unusual data type that is specific to R and its history as a language for statistical analysis.\n\n\nFUN Fact\nR’s predecessor, “S”, was invented at Bell Labs for doing data analysis\n\nFactors look like a character variable:\n\nf1 <- factor(c(\"blue\", \"blue\", \"purple\", \"green\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"green\"))\nf1\n\n[1] blue   blue   purple green  green  yellow green \nLevels: blue green purple yellow\n\n\nIt is a character variable, with pre-defined levels that are alphabetized. The text “Levels: …” are the predefined levels associated with that factor. Let’s compare this to a character variable by manually converting it to character.\n\nas.character(f1)\n\n[1] \"blue\"   \"blue\"   \"purple\" \"green\"  \"green\"  \"yellow\" \"green\" \n\n\nIn the character type, all the observations are in quotes and there is no “Level” information.\nLike other data types, you can manually coerce a fabric as thus:\n\nas.factor(x4)\n\n[1] orange banana\nLevels: banana orange\n\n\nUnder the hood, deep in the R internals, these are integers. The first factor level is designated 1, the second level is designated 2 and so forth. This order is set alphanumerically, but it can be manipulated by hand (run ?factor in the console for more information on how to do this).\n\nas.integer(f1)\n\n[1] 1 1 3 2 2 4 2\n\n\nFactors are used in statistical analysis and can be manipulated in several ways. To a large extent, you can ignore factors. However, you will see them referred to in R functions occasionally. It’s good to know they exist and the very basics of how they work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nLook at the object created in the lesson in the Global Environment pane. For each object, the object class and the first few values will be listed."

    "text": "Introduction to Common Data Structures\nPreviously, we looked at data types. Now we need to consider how those types are arranged into complex structures (that is, objects) we can access and manipulate.\nThere are several data structures commonly used in R:\n\nvector\ndata.frame\nmatrix\nlist\n\n\nThe vector\nA collection of items all coerced to be the same data type that we learned about in the previous lesson. These are sometimes called “atomic vectors” in the R documentation.\n\nv1 <- 1:10\nv2 <- c(\"apples\", \"pears\", \"oranges\")\nv3 <- c(1, 5, 7, 85)\n\nA vector can also consist of only one value or no value.\n\nv4 <- \"violets\"\nv5 <- TRUE\nv6 <- NA\n\nIt has the attribute length and each item in a vector can also be named.\n\nlength(v1); length(v2); length(v3)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\nnames(v3) <- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")\nv3\n\n A  B  C  D \n 1  5  7 85 \n\n\n\nAccessing items\nItems in a vector can be accessed by referencing the numeric position in the vector, starting at 1 and ending at the vector length. If a vector has length of one, it not necessary to index that.\nx[1] will access the first item in the vector, while x[5] will access the 5th element. Multiple item can be indexed: x[c(1,5)]. If an index position, it repeated, that item will be returned as often as it is called:\n\nv1[1]\n\n[1] 1\n\nv1[5]\n\n[1] 5\n\nv1[c(1,5)]\n\n[1] 1 5\n\nv1[c(1,1)]\n\n[1] 1 1\n\n\nAny collection of numbers can be used to index items in a vector:\n\nv1[c(1, 1:5)]\n\n[1] 1 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nWhat happens if a negative number is used?\n\nv1[-1]\n\n[1]  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nEverything but that index position is returned.\nWhat if you index a position that does not exist?\n\nv1[0]\n\ninteger(0)\n\nv1[20]\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nItems in a vector can also be accessed by their name:\n\nv3[\"A\"]\n\nA \n1 \n\n\nWhat happens if there are replicate names in a vector and you try to index (extract a value) for that name?\n\nnames(v3) <- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\")\nv3\n\n A  B  C  A \n 1  5  7 85 \n\nv3[\"A\"]\n\nA \n1 \n\n\nOnly the first instance of a name is returned.\n\n\n\nThe data frame\nA collection of vectors all of the name length. Each vector is a single data type, but different columns can be different data types. This is similar to a typical workbook you might open in Excel or another spreadsheet program. These can be only one column wide, but they often consist of more than that.\n\nd1 <- data.frame(var1 = 1:5,\n                 var2 = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"),\n                 var3 = c(\"alpha\", \"beta\", \"gamma\", \"zeta\", \"psi\"))\nd1\n\n  var1 var2  var3\n1    1    a alpha\n2    2    b  beta\n3    3    a gamma\n4    4    b  zeta\n5    5    c   psi\n\n\nNotes that is a single value is supplied for a column, it will be repeated for the entire column.\nA data frame has attributes for:\n\nnrow number of rows\nncol number of columns\ncolnames column names\nrownames row names (if none are provided, R will generate integer row names starting at 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile duplicate column names in a data frame are allowed, they are not advised, and may throw an error during data import, depending on the import function used.\n\n\nCheck the number of rows and columns:\n\nnrow(d1)\n\n[1] 5\n\nncol(d1); length(d1)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n[1] 3\n\ndim(d1) # tells us row and column lengths in one command\n\n[1] 5 3\n\n\nLook at the rownames and colnames atrributes:\n\nrownames(d1)\n\n[1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\"\n\ncolnames(d1)\n\n[1] \"var1\" \"var2\" \"var3\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe rownames attribute can be set, but if it is not, it is automatically created within R from 1 to the total number of rows. Row names are a tricky attribute than many packages in R do not support. A function may toss out your row names without any warning!\nIn general, I do not recommend setting the row names attribute in data frames to anything other than the default values unless a package function specifically requires it.\n\n\nWhat does length(d1) return? How about names(d1)?\nWe can look at the overall structure of a data.frame with View():\n\nView(d1)\n\nIf a particularly large file is loaded into R, using View() may be very slow (if you have a large number of rows) and provide an incomplete view (if you have a large number of columns). In that case, you can use str() to look at a data frame’s structure:\n\nstr(d1)\n\n'data.frame':   5 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ var1: int  1 2 3 4 5\n $ var2: chr  \"a\" \"b\" \"a\" \"b\" ...\n $ var3: chr  \"alpha\" \"beta\" \"gamma\" \"zeta\" ...\n\n\nThe data frame is the most common data structure scientists use in R\n\nAccessing items\nLike vectors, data frames can be indexed by position, except now we have two dimensions to consider. You can extract individual elements in a data frame by references the row and column position, my_dataframe[row, column].\n\nExtract the items located in the first 2 row2 and last 2 columns:\n\nVisual of what we want:\n\n\n\n\n\n(This graphic is an overlay of green over blue, creating a dark teal color. The green represents rows indexed, the blue is columns indexed and the teal is the intersection between those two. If a color is not visible, that is because it is under the teal overlay.)\n\nd1[1:2, 2:3]\n\n  var2  var3\n1    a alpha\n2    b  beta\n\n\n\nExtract the first two rows and all of the columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd1[1:2, ]\n\n  var1 var2  var3\n1    1    a alpha\n2    2    b  beta\n\n\nWhen the column position is left empty, all columns are returned\n\nExtract the entire first column and all rows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd1[ ,1]\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nWhen the row position is left empty, all rows are returned\n\nExtract the values located in the first 2 rows and first two columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd1[1:2, 1:2]\n\n  var1 var2\n1    1    a\n2    2    b\n\n\n\nReturn everything except the third columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd1[ ,-3]\n\n  var1 var2\n1    1    a\n2    2    b\n3    3    a\n4    4    b\n5    5    c\n\n\n\nReturn everything except the first 2 rows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd1[-(1:2),  ]\n\n  var1 var2  var3\n3    3    a gamma\n4    4    b  zeta\n5    5    c   psi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to note\n\n\n\nIndexing accepts numeric/integer vectors, so you can use a sequence (3:10), or concatenated positions (c(1, 2, 5, 10)), or a combination of both (c(1:10, 13)).\nWhen indexing positions in a vector or data frame (or anything else), the amount of white space does not affect the outcome. These are equivalent: d[1,2], d[1, 2], d[ 1, 2]\n\n\n\n\nColumn Referencing\nData in R data frames can also be referred to by their column names using the notation dataframe$column_name:\n\nd1$var1\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nThe data are returned as a vector (with the typical attributes of a vector: length and names).\nThis can also be used to create a new column in the data frame:\n\nd1$var4 <- 0:-4\n\nIn this example, a new column called “var4” was created, consisting of sequence numbers from zero to -4.\n\n\n  var1 var2  var3 var4\n1    1    a alpha    0\n2    2    b  beta   -1\n3    3    a gamma   -2\n4    4    b  zeta   -3\n5    5    c   psi   -4\n\n\n\n\nValue replacement\nThere are likely to be moments when you want to replace values in a data frame or vector with something else. You can do that with indexing and variable assignment.\nLet’s image that we want to assign the third value in the second column as NA. First, we index the that position, then we assign a value to it (NA in this case):\n\nd1[3, 2] <- NA\n\n\n\n\nThe matrix\nA very mile-high view of the matrix is given here because you while may encounter this, it is a less commonly used data structure in R.\nLike a data frame, a matrix is a collection of vectors all the same length, except all vectors must be the same data type (e.g. numeric, character, etc).\nAn R matrix is not strictly identical to the mathematical concept of a matrix, but if you make an R matrix consisting only of numbers, it can be used like a mathematical matrix. Furthermore, there several mathematical operations that are intended to only work on matrices such as matrix pre-multiplication %*% or extraction of a diagonal from a square matrix, diag().\nA matrix lacks some of the attributes and functionality that are possible for data frames. Columns names can be given, but they cannot be used to index columns (i.e. my_matrix$col will throw an error).\nMatrices are not commonly seen in user-facing functions in R, but within R internals, they are widely used. You may occasionally come across a package requiring a matrix or perhaps you work in a math-intensive discipline where matrix operations are part of your regular work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFYI: how to make a matrix\n\n\n\n\n\nA matrix can be created by providing a vector of numbers and telling it to populate a table of given dimensions:\n\nx = 1:100\nm1 <- matrix(data = x, nrow = 5, ncol = 20, byrow = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe list\nThis is the least structured and hence most flexible data structure that exists in R. A list is like a closet that happens to be filled with other objects, or your kitchen sink, or the trunk of your car. It’s a collection of objects of varying sizes, types, and so on. A vector, scalar and data frame can all be combined into a list. A list can contain other lists inside of it (although this list nesting can be cumbersome to deal with).\n\nL1 <- list(v1, v2, v3, d1, m1)\nstr(L1)\n\nList of 5\n $ : int [1:10] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n $ : chr [1:3] \"apples\" \"pears\" \"oranges\"\n $ : Named num [1:4] 1 5 7 85\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"A\"\n $ :'data.frame':   5 obs. of  4 variables:\n  ..$ var1: int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\n  ..$ var2: chr [1:5] \"a\" \"b\" NA \"b\" ...\n  ..$ var3: chr [1:5] \"alpha\" \"beta\" \"gamma\" \"zeta\" ...\n  ..$ var4: int [1:5] 0 -1 -2 -3 -4\n $ : int [1:5, 1:20] 1 21 41 61 81 2 22 42 62 82 ...\n\n\nEach list item can have a name. Or not.\n\nL1 <- list(\"number\" = v1, \"flower\" = v3, v4, \"df\" = d1, m1)\nnames(L1)\n\n[1] \"number\" \"flower\" \"\"       \"df\"     \"\"      \n\nstr(L1)\n\nList of 5\n $ number: int [1:10] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n $ flower: Named num [1:4] 1 5 7 85\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"A\"\n $       : chr \"violets\"\n $ df    :'data.frame': 5 obs. of  4 variables:\n  ..$ var1: int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\n  ..$ var2: chr [1:5] \"a\" \"b\" NA \"b\" ...\n  ..$ var3: chr [1:5] \"alpha\" \"beta\" \"gamma\" \"zeta\" ...\n  ..$ var4: int [1:5] 0 -1 -2 -3 -4\n $       : int [1:5, 1:20] 1 21 41 61 81 2 22 42 62 82 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you end up with too many objects in your global environment, you can always delete them with the rm() function:\nrm(myvar)\nrm(var1, var2, var3)\nIf one object ends up with the wrong name, you can copy the object to a new name and delete the old version:\nnew <- old\nrm(old)\n\n\n\nAccessing items\nAs mentioned earlier, lists are relatively unstructured and follow fewer rules. You can access list items by their numeric position, list[[1]], or their name (if it exists), list$name.\n\nL1[[1]]\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nL1$df\n\n  var1 var2  var3 var4\n1    1    a alpha    0\n2    2    b  beta   -1\n3    3 <NA> gamma   -2\n4    4    b  zeta   -3\n5    5    c   psi   -4\n\n\nOnce a list item is accessed, the normal indexing rules apply. The 4th item in the list called “L1” is a data frame.\n\nL1[[4]]\n\n  var1 var2  var3 var4\n1    1    a alpha    0\n2    2    b  beta   -1\n3    3 <NA> gamma   -2\n4    4    b  zeta   -3\n5    5    c   psi   -4\n\nL1[[4]]$var1\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nL1[[4]][1:2,]\n\n  var1 var2  var3 var4\n1    1    a alpha    0\n2    2    b  beta   -1"

However, we can specify each argument when calling a function:\n\nfunction_name(arg1 = value1, arg2 = value2, arg3 = value3)\n\nWhen specifying the argument explicitly, we don’t have to follow the order of arguments:\n\nfunction_name(arg1 = value1, arg3 = value3, arg2 = value3)\n\nThis approach of using named arguments is very helpful when there is a very long list of potential argument and you only plan to specify a small portion of them.\nWe can also combined positional argument and named arguments:\n\nfunction_name(value1, arg3 = value3)\n\nIn this case, arg2 has been completed omitted. When an argument is not specified, that implies the default arguments for that function will be used instead. In order to find out the default argument values for a function, we need to consult the R help files.\n\n\nUsing R Help\nYou can search for a function directly using the search windows in the upper right of the “Help” pane.\nYou can also search using this notation: ?function_name.\nLet’s check out the help file for sample(), a function designed to randomly sample items and return that random sample to us.\n\n?sample\n\nHere is a screenshot of the window that hopefully popped up in your RStudio help pane:\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"help_sample_ex.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nAll help files follow this format\n\nDescription what the function does\nUsage how the function is called; this is where default argument may be listed\nArgument the named arguments available in the function (often the most useful part of the help file)\nDetails an optional section providing various computational details\nValue what is returned after the function is run\nReferences any technical, scientific or peer-reviewed lit references supporting the computational procedures implemented in the function\nSee Also similar functions (usually not very useful)\nExamples actual examples of the function in the wild! These are hit-or-miss on their overall utility, but when I’m desperate to understand how to properly call a function, this has helped me.\n\nAt the very bottom is the package the function came from and a link to an index of all functions associated with that package. This can come in handy when you want to browse all functions available in a package.\nLooking at the sample() help file, here is what is it telling us:\n\nThe first argument is a vector of choices for the function to sample randomly\nThe next argument is the number to sample. By default, it will return a sample the same length at the input vector of choices\nThe third argument indicates that if a vector should be sampled with replacement (that is, can items be repeatedly sampled). The default is FALSE (meaning no).\nWe can also specify the probability of sampling any item in the input vector. If we don’t provide this information, then all item is assumed to have equal probabilities of being sampled.\nIt will return a vector of the item sampled\n\n\nx <- 1:100\nx\n\n  [1]   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18\n [19]  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36\n [37]  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54\n [55]  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72\n [73]  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90\n [91]  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100\n\nsample(x, 10, replace = TRUE)\n\n [1] 21 82 88 95 67 39 19 27 42 73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is normal to struggle with R code. Newer users of R struggle more than seasoned users, but we all end up experiencing an apparently intractable problem, one that we cannot solve despite our best efforts. The first response may be to Google that problem (which may yield helpful information), but there are also more efficient search strategies you can employ to solve your R coding problem. Here is a blog post addressing that very topic: how to find help when we are stuck.\n\n\n\n\nBack to functions\nFunctions can return exactly one object (or none at all). If it does return an object, that can be assigned to a new object:\n\nnew <- function_name(value1, arg3 = value3)\n\nIf the output from a function is not assigned, it will be sent to the console instead (we’ve done this plenty during this workshop). Sometimes, this is fine! Maybe it is a small amount of output we are running to check data integrity. Or maybe it’s a giant data frame we deeply regret printing in the console.\n\n\nBase R and Contributed Libraries\nThis is the last section with a major focus on ‘base R’, that is the set of functions that come automatically loaded when you install and open R.\nTake a look at this long-ish cheat sheet (4 pages long!) of the many useful commands in base R. Skim through this and see if there is anything useful for you. It is meant to periodically skimmed, not studied in great detail (you’ll put yourself to sleep if you try to read it beginning to end).\nAdditionally, here is the ultimate guide to working with the R language. This is a long, highly technical document, but it is also incredibly detailed and informative. Reading this is like reading an encyclopedia - only read a a small section at a time. I do not recommend reading this beginning to end.\n\nLibraries\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"sokka_library.gif\"))\n\n\n\n\nBut also, the community keeps R humming and current by writing packages that extend R’s functionality. This is both awesome (the latest greatest tool is now enabled!) and bad (quality of implementation is not guaranteed and these packages are often not maintained over the long haul).\nThese packages are often made available on CRAN, the comprehensive R archive network, as well Bioconductor or via GitHub, GitLab, independent websites.\nYou can access packages on CRAN by first installing them with install.packages(\"package_name\") and then loading the package into an R session, library(package_name). Here’s an example using readr and *readxl**, packages we will use for data importation.\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"readr\", \"readxl\"))\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nNote that multiple packages can be listed in the install.packages() command, but not library(). Also, packages only need to be installed once, not repeatedly (unless a package needs to be a updated to the latest version). However, packages must be loaded in every R session or their functionality (including the help files) is not available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nWhen you search for something in the Help pane, several types of help files will result: vignettes and function documentation. Function documentation is what we have just reviewed (detailed information on how to use a function). Vignettes are examples of how to use a collection of function in a package. They provide more context and a programmatic flow for using a package or accomplishing a particular goal. They are package tutorials. Vignettes are not provided for every function or every package; they are an extra feature that package authors choose to create for users.\nThere is an enormous number of R packages available! There are a few options for finding packages relevant to your work: * CRAN Task Views * Bioconductor Workflows"

    "text": "Working directory and file paths\nWhile you can simulate data or load existing data sets associated with packages for your research, most of you will need to load pre-existing data sets from you computer, or a cloud server, some other external device.\nThe first thing you need to understand is the working directory and file paths. When an R session is initiated, it ascertains what the root working directory is based on the default settings for your R installation and any other.\nYou can check this with getwd(). You can set the file path relative to the current working directory or set an absolute path (that is, independent of your current directory). You can read more about absolute and relative paths here.\nWhen opening an R project (an .Rproj file), the working directory is automatically set to the directory where the .Rproj is located. Otherise, you can set the working directory using setwd() or under “Session” in the RStudio Ribbon.\n\nQuarto files and the {Here} package\nWhen working with an R notebook like a Quarto document or an Rmarkdown document, the working directory within code chunks is automatically set to where the quarto document is located on your file system. This is the case regardless of whether you set the working directory or where the .Rproj file is located.\nTo import a data set located in another directory from where the quarto document is located, you can use bash strategies for navigating up and down directory structures (e.g. “../data/somefile.csv”). Another solution is to use the here.\nThe function here() in the here package will reconstruct a path based on the system you are using (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc). Each directory must be specified and the final item specified is the file to import.\n\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere() starts at /home/runner/work/r-for-ag-scientists/r-for-ag-scientists\n\nhere(\"directory1\", \"subdirectory\", \"my_file.txt\")\n\n[1] \"/home/runner/work/r-for-ag-scientists/r-for-ag-scientists/directory1/subdirectory/my_file.txt\"\n\n\nIf you don’t want to load an entire package, but use the function from it, you can use the notation package_name::function(). The code below uses that when calling the here() function: here::here()."

But, they do generate R code that we can capture and reuse. They are handy shortcuts that I have found especially helpful when trying to import file formats I work with rarely.\n\n\n\nManual command line import\n\nUltimately, this is how anything is imported into R. As mentioned, first two options listed above are actually tools for generating code that will import a data set through the command-line!\nThere’s 4 common approaches for importing data into R:\n\nread.csv()\nread_csv()\nread_excel()\nread_delim()\n\n\nread.csv()\nA very commonly used function for reading in “comma separated values” (CSV) files. I personally like this format because it is not proprietary and is compatible across many operating systems. It also limits all sorts of extraneous formatting that itself is a barrier to reproducible research (e.g. highlighting is discarded once a CSV file is closed).\nExample usage:\n\nmycsv1 <- read.csv(here::here(\"data\", \"trial_metadata.csv\"))\n\nResult:\n\nstr(mycsv1)\n\n'data.frame':   28 obs. of  30 variables:\n $ trial             : chr  \"SWIdahoCereals_HWW_PAR_2020\" \"SWIdahoCereals_SWW_PAR_2020\" \"SWIdahoCereals_H_W_PAR_2018\" \"SWIdahoCereals_SWW_PAR_2018\" ...\n $ program           : chr  \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" ...\n $ pi                : chr  \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" ...\n $ nursery           : chr  \"HWW\" \"SWW\" \"H_W\" \"SWW\" ...\n $ year              : int  2020 2020 2018 2018 2018 2018 2016 2016 2016 2017 ...\n $ location          : chr  \"Parma\" \"Parma\" \"Parma\" \"Parma\" ...\n $ grower_cooperator : chr  \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" ...\n $ irrigation        : chr  \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" ...\n $ latitude          : num  43.8 43.8 43.8 43.8 43.8 ...\n $ longitude         : num  -117 -117 -117 -117 -117 ...\n $ planting_date     : chr  \"2019-10-07\" \"2019-10-07\" \"2017-10-25\" \"2017-10-25\" ...\n $ harvest_date      : chr  \"2020-07-21\" \"2020-07-21\" \"2018-07-17\" \"2018-07-17\" ...\n $ plot_length       : int  17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 ...\n $ plot_width        : int  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ...\n $ agronomic_notes   : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ chemical_trts     : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ free_lime_pct     : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ k_ppm             : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ n_lbs_acre        : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ npks_lb_acre      : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ p_ppm             : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ ph                : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ previous_crop     : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ row_spacing_in    : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ s_ppm             : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ seed_rate_per_acre: logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ seed_trt          : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ soil.type         : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ soil_om           : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ exp_design        : chr  \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" ...\n\n\nDetails:\nread.csv() is actually a “wrapper” for another function, read.table(). It has taken read.table() and set the default arguments to work with CSV files. read.table() is a more generalized form providing more flexibility.\nThe default arguments include:\n\ncolnames = TRUE: the first row of data is assumed to be the column names * nothing in the data set will be used for row names unless we explicitly indicate so\nsep = \",\": each data point is separated from another by a comma * a newline indicator is used to separate rows of data\nna.strings = c(\"NA\", \"\"): cells with a either no data (““) or an”NA” will be treated as missing.\nif a column of data consists of non-numeric characters, that column vector will be treated as character and not a factor\n\n\n\nread_csv()\nThis function is part of readr. It has very similar functionality to read.csv(), but it parses the data a wee bit different.\nExample Usage:\nFirst, load the package readr that contains the function read_csv().\n\nlibrary(readr)\nmycsv2 <- read_csv(here::here(\"data\", \"trial_metadata.csv\"))\n\nRows: 28 Columns: 30\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (8): trial, program, pi, nursery, location, grower_cooperator, irrigat...\ndbl   (5): year, latitude, longitude, plot_length, plot_width\nlgl  (15): agronomic_notes, chemical_trts, free_lime_pct, k_ppm, n_lbs_acre,...\ndate  (2): planting_date, harvest_date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nResult:\n\nstr(mycsv2)\n\nspc_tbl_ [28 × 30] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ trial             : chr [1:28] \"SWIdahoCereals_HWW_PAR_2020\" \"SWIdahoCereals_SWW_PAR_2020\" \"SWIdahoCereals_H_W_PAR_2018\" \"SWIdahoCereals_SWW_PAR_2018\" ...\n $ program           : chr [1:28] \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" ...\n $ pi                : chr [1:28] \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" ...\n $ nursery           : chr [1:28] \"HWW\" \"SWW\" \"H_W\" \"SWW\" ...\n $ year              : num [1:28] 2020 2020 2018 2018 2018 ...\n $ location          : chr [1:28] \"Parma\" \"Parma\" \"Parma\" \"Parma\" ...\n $ grower_cooperator : chr [1:28] \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" ...\n $ irrigation        : chr [1:28] \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" ...\n $ latitude          : num [1:28] 43.8 43.8 43.8 43.8 43.8 ...\n $ longitude         : num [1:28] -117 -117 -117 -117 -117 ...\n $ planting_date     : Date[1:28], format: \"2019-10-07\" \"2019-10-07\" ...\n $ harvest_date      : Date[1:28], format: \"2020-07-21\" \"2020-07-21\" ...\n $ plot_length       : num [1:28] 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 ...\n $ plot_width        : num [1:28] 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ...\n $ agronomic_notes   : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ chemical_trts     : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ free_lime_pct     : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ k_ppm             : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ n_lbs_acre        : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ npks_lb_acre      : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ p_ppm             : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ ph                : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ previous_crop     : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ row_spacing_in    : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ s_ppm             : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ seed_rate_per_acre: logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ seed_trt          : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ soil type         : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ soil_om           : logi [1:28] NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ exp_design        : chr [1:28] \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   trial = col_character(),\n  ..   program = col_character(),\n  ..   pi = col_character(),\n  ..   nursery = col_character(),\n  ..   year = col_double(),\n  ..   location = col_character(),\n  ..   grower_cooperator = col_character(),\n  ..   irrigation = col_character(),\n  ..   latitude = col_double(),\n  ..   longitude = col_double(),\n  ..   planting_date = col_date(format = \"\"),\n  ..   harvest_date = col_date(format = \"\"),\n  ..   plot_length = col_double(),\n  ..   plot_width = col_double(),\n  ..   agronomic_notes = col_logical(),\n  ..   chemical_trts = col_logical(),\n  ..   free_lime_pct = col_logical(),\n  ..   k_ppm = col_logical(),\n  ..   n_lbs_acre = col_logical(),\n  ..   npks_lb_acre = col_logical(),\n  ..   p_ppm = col_logical(),\n  ..   ph = col_logical(),\n  ..   previous_crop = col_logical(),\n  ..   row_spacing_in = col_logical(),\n  ..   s_ppm = col_logical(),\n  ..   seed_rate_per_acre = col_logical(),\n  ..   seed_trt = col_logical(),\n  ..   `soil type` = col_logical(),\n  ..   soil_om = col_logical(),\n  ..   exp_design = col_character()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=<externalptr> \n\n\nDetails:\nThis function takes similar arguments to read.csv(), although the output is more extensive.\n\nLike in read.csv(), the default separator is “,”, missing datea are coded as empty string \"\" or NA and the first line is assumed to be the column header\nit does not bother with a row names attribute\nthe argument trim_ws will remove leading and trailing whitespace for data entries.

It’s pretty simple. Text files are not used terribly frequently, but I see them now and then with really huge files, such as genotyping data.\n\nmytxt <- read.delim(here::here(\"data\", \"genotypic_data.txt\"))\n\nDetails\nThis function is a more extensive version of read.csv(). It has a longer list of argument and slight different default values for those arguments that read.csv. Run ?write.delim in the console for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt’s useful to understand how R has read a data set into an R session. R has opened a connection to the file that you have specified, read file information into the R session using system memory (your computer’s RAM), and then closed the connection.\nThis is a one-way process from your file to R\nOnce a file is loaded and the connection closed, there is no longer any link between the object loaded into memory in R and its origin file (located on on your computer, a cloud server, etc). Any changes made to the object in R will not change the file on your computer unless you explicitly run scripts to overwrite that file. This is good thing; it gives you freedom to experiment with and manipulate an object without worrying about messing up the original file.\nWe will discuss later how to export R objects to your file system when you want to capture changes made to an object.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting Import errors\nThings frequently go wrong when importing data. This can sometimes be corrected by changing the import arguments, but often it indicates problems with the incoming data.\nSome possible errors and how to fix them:\n\nSome variables which should be numeric are characters instead. At least one item contains an unexpected character that renders that observation - and the rest of the vector - as a character. This might be two decimal points, a comma, or a “O” instead of “0”. If possible, manually inspect the data and correct the error.\nMissing data are not coded as missing. Import functions have default values for what is interpreted as missing. Check the documentation and adjust the arguments as needed to capture what code a data sets is using to indicate missing data.\n\nThe best choice is to properly arrange your data set prior to import. Broman & Woo (2018) provides some straightforward recommendations on how to manage data in spreadsheets.\n\n\nImporting Other Data types\nThe instructions provided above are for importing tabular data that is generally not “big data”.\nBig data is a subjective term that is system-dependent (and is rapidly changing as PC computing power and memory increases). Some personal computers can easily handle a 50 Mb file, while others cannot. If you are waiting more than 5 seconds for your data to import, then consider other options. A deep discussion about how to handle large data sets are beyond the scope of this workshop, but at the very minimum, consider the package data.table and its high-performance functions for reading and writing data, fread() and fwrite(). If your data sets are too big to load directly into R, consider arrow.\nYou may also be working with data types that are not strictly tabular, at least in the form they are stored on a computer. Here are some common non-tabular data types and packages to handle import of those.\n\nspatial data: sf, sp, raster\nSAS data sets: haven, haven::read_sas()\nSPSS data sets: haven, haven::read_sav()\ntabular files on Google drive: googledrive\nimage files: magick\n\n…and so much more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nNote how easy it is to import data from the ‘Files’ pane; navigate to the file and click on it! It’s important that that the code generated is saved so (1) you can reuse the code; and (2) so you can link the data set loaded to a set of R commands you ran should you ever need to rerun them (which is highly likely)."

    "text": "Vectors\n\nThere is no difference. If there is only item in a vector, it does not need to be indexed by position.\nThe way to do this shown in class:\n\n\nv1 = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"N\", \"O\", \"P\", \"Q\", \"R\", \"S\", \"T\", \"U\", \"V\", \"W\", \"X\", \"Y\", \"Z\")\nv1\n\n [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\" \"f\" \"g\" \"h\" \"i\" \"j\" \"k\" \"l\" \"m\" \"N\" \"O\" \"P\" \"Q\" \"R\" \"S\"\n[20] \"T\" \"U\" \"V\" \"W\" \"X\" \"Y\" \"Z\"\n\n\nThis is rather cumbersome. An easier way is to use the preset vectors letters and LETTERS which are the english alphabet in lowercase and uppercase, respectively. The index position 1 of each corresponds to the first letter of the alphabet, “a” or “A”.\n\nv1 <- c(letters[1:13], LETTERS[14:26])\nv1\n\n [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\" \"f\" \"g\" \"h\" \"i\" \"j\" \"k\" \"l\" \"m\" \"N\" \"O\" \"P\" \"Q\" \"R\" \"S\"\n[20] \"T\" \"U\" \"V\" \"W\" \"X\" \"Y\" \"Z\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFYI\n\n\n\nIf something seems tedious and slow in R, there is probably a shortcut.\n\n\n\nThe vector:\n\n\nv2 <- c(1:10, 2:50)\n\n\n\nData Frames\n\nA possible data frame:\n\n\nd1 <- data.frame(var1 = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE),\n                 var2 = 1:6,\n                 var3 = \"orange\",\n                 var4 = as.factor(c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"blue\", \"purple\", \"green\", \"green\")))\n\nstr(d1)\n\n'data.frame':   6 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ var1: logi  TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n $ var2: int  1 2 3 4 5 6\n $ var3: chr  \"orange\" \"orange\" \"orange\" \"orange\" ...\n $ var4: Factor w/ 4 levels \"blue\",\"green\",..: 4 1 1 3 2 2\n\n\nThe function str() is for checking the structure of an object.
