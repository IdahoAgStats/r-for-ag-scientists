    "text": "This workshop will take you from zero to hero over the course of 16 hours of instruction and practice. It will introduce the R programming language, the graphical user interface RStudio and how R can be used to manage and analyse your data. At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:\n\nimport & export data\nunderstand data types and object types\nfilter, reshape, merge and manipulate your data\nmathematically transform data\ndo repeat actions in R\nplot data\nnavigate R help files\n\n\nWho is This workshop for?\nThis workshop is intended for beginner R users. No previous experience in R or any other programming or statistical language is expected (although previous R users whose skills have lapsed are welcomed!)\n\n\nWhat this workshop will not cover\n\ngit, GitHub, or any version control\nusage of the terminal (e.g. bash)\nstatistical analysis\n\n\nRequirements\nComputer with a stable internet connection. A camera for zoom.\n\n\nWhen\nJan 17 - February 9\nTuesday/Thursdays\n2 - 4 pm Pacific time\nAll sessions will take place over Zoom so students across different timezones can participate.\n\n\nInstructors:\nJulia Piaskowski | GitHub"

    "text": "RStudio is more than a graphical user interface for R. It is an integrated development environment (IDE), that is a full service application for supporting software development. It can perform multitudes, so more than most people need. It is the supermarket of R functionality. Like a supermarket, there are parts of RStudio you will visit frequently and parts you will rarely if ever use. After 10+ years of using RStudio on a near daily basis, there are several parts of it that I continue to be unfamiliar with! Ths is okay - clearly, I have not needed those parts. You will come to find what sections youn will need most over time and practice.\nStill, it helps to have a guided tour. Let’s dive into this."

All of R consists of packages or libraries that have certain functionality associated with them. Some of are maintained by the R core team, others are maintained by outsiders. All packages are open source and most are a volunteer effort. When you open R, several packages are loaded automatically: base, datasets, graphics, grDevices, methods, stats, utils.\n\n\nEnvironment/History/Connections/Build/Git/Tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTab\nFunction\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment\nobjects created and existing in your current R session\n\n\nHistory\nprevious R command run\n\n\nConnections\nto connect to an external database\n\n\nBuild\nfor building R packages and other large projects\n\n\nGit\nonly visible if you’ve initialized a git repository\n\n\nTutorial\ntutorials build by Posit (very helpful)\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Scripts Pane\ndefault location: upper left\nThese are all the files we create and edit: .R, .Rmd, .txt, …\nwhen we open files from the “Files” pane, this is where it shows up"
