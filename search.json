This the beauty and drawback of R (yay for new functionality, boo to the inconvenience). R is updated frequently, usually several times per year. Not every update is important, but over time, older versions of R will cause you problems because they will work poorly with installed packages. New packages will not work at all with older version of R and older packages will have problems, requiring to also install older package versions. This is a pain to manage; its easiest to keep R updated.",

It’s not strictly related to reshaping. Only try this if you are in the mood for a challenge.\n\nThis problem is indicative of a data wrangling you can experience out in the wild. You are given a data set in one format, but a package requires your data be in another format.\nThe file “genotypic_data.txt” is a transposed version of “genotypic_data_rotated.csv”.

Often the best way to handle how missing values from your data are handled is to specify that when the file is read in. Check the documentation for your import function, e.g. read.csv(..., na.string = \"...\").\nTo do a global replacement of NA with another value, use tidyr::replace_na()\nTo do a global replacement of another value with NA, this can be handled in the import, or use dplyr::na_if()\n\n\n\n\nRepeating operatio across a list\n😍😍😍😍😍 lapply() 😍😍😍😍😍\n\nVectorised over lists\nIf you can express one aspect of your operation as a list, this can probably work for you!\nDownside: everything comes back as a list (it takes an effort to convert this into a more exportable form)\nIt uses very simple notation:\n\n\nlapply(list, some_function)\n\n\nExample\n\n\nintegers &lt;- sample(1:100, 200, replace = TRUE)\nthrice_int &lt;- lapply(integers, function(x) x*(c(1,2,3)))\n\nI’m very fond of this for doing complex repeat operations. Perhaps I have a group of experiments, all with identical experimental design, that each need to be analyzed the same. Using a list can accomplish this efficiently.\n\nlapply() flotsam & jetsam\n\nDealing with lists can be challenging: they follow different rules; they typically require lots and lots of indexing to extract content. And you usually can’t write a list straight to file like a data.frame.\n\nsapply() is just like lapply(), except it tries to simplify to common R data objects - a matrix or array. This works if the return data is one row.\ndplyr::bind_rows() can concatenate data.frames better than rbind().\nGetting things out of a list and into the desired format can be one of the most challenging aspects of working with lapply() (bonus: it makes you understand R data types really well!).\npurrr to the rescue!\n\n\n\n\npurrr for repeat operations\npurrr does all of the hard work of iteration plus conversion of output to the object type you want! It works on data structures of all types: vectors, data frames and lists.\n\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n  split(.$cyl) %&gt;%\n  map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .x)) %&gt;%\n  map_dfr(~ as.data.frame(t(as.matrix(coef(.)))))\n\n  (Intercept)        wt\n1    39.57120 -5.647025\n2    28.40884 -2.780106\n3    23.86803 -2.192438\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\npurrr is complicated!

However, you can learn more about it here and Introduction to R manual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how to do repeat operations in R often requires a strong understanding of the underlying data structures we are trying to perform those operations on. This aspect of R, sometimes called “data conditioning” can be one of the most challenging aspects of using R. When writing repeat operations, check back on Lessons 3 and 4 that address basics of data types and data structures if you are having trouble."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Learning Goals\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of this lesson, you should:\n\nUnderstand how to call functions using named and positional arguments\nBe able to access help files for an R function and know how to use the information provided in a help file\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mechanics of R Functions\nWe have thus far used a few R functions without explicitly stating how to call them properly.\nThe majority of functions in R follow this format:\n\nfunction_name(arg1, arg2, arg3)\n\nWhere “arg” refers to a function argument (that is, a piece of information the function can use).\nA function has a name, and can take several arguments within the parentheses. These argument values can be provided by providing each argument in the expected order:\n\nfunction_name(value1, value2, value3)\n\nNote that each positional argument is not being explicitly referenced. However, we can specify each argument when calling a function:\n\nfunction_name(arg1 = value1, arg2 = value2, arg3 = value3)\n\nWhen specifying the argument explicitly, we don’t have to follow the order of arguments:\n\nfunction_name(arg1 = value1, arg3 = value3, arg2 = value3)\n\nThis approach of using named arguments is very helpful when there is a very long list of potential argument and you only plan to specify a small portion of them.\nWe can also combined positional argument and named arguments:\n\nfunction_name(value1, arg3 = value3)\n\nIn this case, arg2 has been completed omitted. When an argument is not specified, that implies the default arguments for that function will be used instead. In order to find out the default argument values for a function, we need to consult the R help files.\n\n\nUsing R Help\nYou can search for a function directly using the search windows in the upper right of the “Help” pane.\nYou can also search using this notation: ?function_name.\nLet’s check out the help file for sample(), a function designed to randomly sample items and return that random sample to us.\n\n?sample\n\nHere is a screenshot of the window that hopefully popped up in your RStudio help pane:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll help files follow this format\n\nDescription what the function does\nUsage how the function is called; this is where default argument may be listed\nArgument the named arguments available in the function (often the most useful part of the help file)\nDetails an optional section providing various computational details\nValue what is returned after the function is run\nReferences any technical, scientific or peer-reviewed lit references supporting the computational procedures implemented in the function\nSee Also similar functions (usually not very useful)\nExamples actual examples of the function in the wild! These are hit-or-miss on their overall utility, but when I’m desperate to understand how to properly call a function, this has helped me.\n\nAt the very bottom is the package the function came from and a link to an index of all functions associated with that package. This can come in handy when you want to browse all functions available in a package.\nLooking at the sample() help file, here is what is it telling us:\n\nThe first argument is a vector of choices for the function to sample randomly\nThe next argument is the number to sample. By default, it will return a sample the same length at the input vector of choices\nThe third argument indicates that if a vector should be sampled with replacement (that is, can items be repeatedly sampled). The default is FALSE (meaning no).\nWe can also specify the probability of sampling any item in the input vector. If we don’t provide this information, then all item is assumed to have equal probabilities of being sampled.\nIt will return a vector of the item sampled\n\n\nx &lt;- 1:100\nx\n\n  [1]   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18\n [19]  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36\n [37]  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54\n [55]  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72\n [73]  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90\n [91]  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100\n\nsample(x, 10, replace = TRUE)\n\n [1] 77 80 88 94 11  4 78 81 15  7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is normal to struggle with R code. Newer users of R struggle more than seasoned users, but we all end up experiencing an apparently intractable problem, one that we cannot solve despite our best efforts. The first response may be to Google that problem (which may yield helpful information), but there are also more efficient search strategies you can employ to solve your R coding problem. Here is a blog post addressing that very topic: how to find help when we are stuck.\n\n\n\n\nBack to functions\nFunctions can return exactly one object (or none at all). If it does return an object, that can be assigned to a new object:\n\nnew &lt;- function_name(value1, arg3 = value3)\n\nIf the output from a function is not assigned, it will be sent to the console instead (we’ve done this plenty during this workshop). Sometimes, this is fine! Maybe it is a small amount of output we are running to check data integrity. Or maybe it’s a giant data frame we deeply regret printing in the console.\n\n\nBase R and Contributed Libraries\nThis is the last section with a major focus on ‘base R’, that is the set of functions that come automatically loaded when you install and open R.\nTake a look at this long-ish cheat sheet (4 pages long!) of the many useful commands in base R. Skim through this and see if there is anything useful for you. It is meant to periodically skimmed, not studied in great detail (you’ll put yourself to sleep if you try to read it beginning to end).\nAdditionally, here is the ultimate guide to working with the R language. This is a long, highly technical document, but it is also incredibly detailed and informative. Reading this is like reading an encyclopedia - only read a a small section at a time. I do not recommend reading this beginning to end.\n\nLibraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut also, the community keeps R humming and current by writing packages that extend R’s functionality. This is both awesome (the latest greatest tool is now enabled!) and bad (quality of implementation is not guaranteed and these packages are often not maintained over the long haul).\nThese packages are often made available on CRAN, the comprehensive R archive network, as well Bioconductor or via GitHub, GitLab, independent websites.\nYou can access packages on CRAN by first installing them with install.packages(\"package_name\") and then loading the package into an R session, library(package_name). Here’s an example using readr and *readxl**, packages we will use for data importation.\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"readr\", \"readxl\"))\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nNote that multiple packages can be listed in the install.packages() command, but not library(). Also, packages only need to be installed once, not repeatedly (unless a package needs to be a updated to the latest version). However, packages must be loaded in every R session or their functionality (including the help files) is not available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nWhen you search for something in the Help pane, several types of help files will result: vignettes and function documentation. Function documentation is what we have just reviewed (detailed information on how to use a function). Vignettes are examples of how to use a collection of function in a package. They provide more context and a programmatic flow for using a package or accomplishing a particular goal. They are package tutorials. Vignettes are not provided for every function or every package; they are an extra feature that package authors choose to create for users.\nThere is an enormous number of R packages available! There are a few options for finding packages relevant to your work: * CRAN Task Views * Bioconductor Workflows"

    "text": "Welcome & Salutations!\nWe excited to teach this course. We have revamped this curriculum so that we get everyone doing practical coding with data as soon as possible.\nWe have limited time, so order to conserve class time and have us all ready for the first day of class, please read through this “Lesson Zero” and follow the instructions below.\n\nInstall R & RStudio.\nFollow these instructions for installing R and RStudio. R is the actual programmatic engine that you can do cool things with, and RStudio is an “integrated development environment” (IDE) to help us use R effectively. Some of the screenshots are for an older version of R; please install the latest version of R (4.4 as of May 1, 2024).\n\n\nJoin Posit Cloud\nYou will receive a link via email from us to join our online classroom on Posit Cloud, where you will need to sign up for an account using your email, or you can connect it to a Gmail or GitHub account (any of these choices will work fine for the class). If do you not have a Gmail or GitHub account or prefer not to use those, you can use your normal work email instead. Once you receive the invitation and have created an account, follow these instructions for accessing the classroom.\n\n\nClass Structure\nFor all lessons, please follow along in R + RStudio or Posit Cloud session. In most instances, you will type and run the same code that we will demonstrate. Actually typing out the code rather than cut-and-pasting is how you learn.\nAdditionally, all code generated that day will be posted on the Posit Cloud ‘classroom’. It is important that you read through notes and try to run to do the exercises if (1) you had to miss some or all of a class, or (2) there is material you do not understand.\nIt is very important that you use the time between class sessions to ensure you understand the material.\n\n\nClass absences\nIt’s okay to miss class or a lecture - we all have stuff going on. There is no need to tell us in advance. As mentioned above, if you miss class, please be sure to catch up on the course material you missed by reading the course notes, running the content and attempting the exercises. Falling behind in the content can create problems with the following content, so please make every effort to stay current with the class.\n\n\nClass Notes Structure\nAs mentioned, all code run will be captured in class notes that will be posted. While you can read those notes and not attend class, many find it helpful to attend a live course and receive live instruction and feedback from an expert.\nAt the beginning of each lesson, this box will be included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Goals\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be a list of what each lesson intends to teach.\nIf you do not think you have met those learning goals, please review the notes, and if the material is still unclear, contact us.\n\n\n\nAt the end of most lessons, this box will be included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nTips designed to weave together information from multiple lessons.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Suceed in Learning R\nLearning R is hard. It has a very steep learning curve. You will spend some amount of time lost and confused. At first, your work may look or feel like some of the baking attempts from the TV show “Nailed It”, where amateur bakers attempt to make very intricate baked concoctions:\n\nThat is normal and okay. It means you are trying to active engage with the material. Keep engaging in this process of learning to code. Many of you may have never programmed in any language before, where others do have previous programming experience. After time and regular practice, your R code will look better and most importantly, be easier for you to write. The purpose of this workshop is to reduce the amount of time you spent in the zone of learning pain:\n\nHere are some tips on how to succeed in learning R from this workshop:\n\nAt the end of each class (or when you have a free moment in the class), review the learning goals and decide if you met those goals. These are designed to be the bare minimum of knowledge to competently use R. Later workshop content builds on this knowledge.\n\nReview what we have covered between classes - refresh your knowledge.\nIf there are practice problems, do them (we will give time during class).\nExperiment in the R console using what you learned. Really, nothing can go wrong.\nIf class material is not clear, re-run the code from class and reread the notes; If it’s still not clear, ask up questions. We are here to help.\n\n\n\nYour very first R lesson!\n\nR is case-sensitive! (data is different from Data and DATA). This means when typing commands, exercise great care and attention to detail so your code works.\nThere is no “undo” button in R. Once a command is run, you can’t undo it!

In the data1, if we select each column varible, it will be returned as a vector.\nData in R data frames can also be referred to by their column names using the notation dataframe$column_name:\n\nyield &lt;- data1$yield\nSite &lt;- data1$site\n\nThe yield and site variables are returned as a vector (with the typical attributes of a vector: length and names).\n\nVector Length\n\nTo find out how many items a vector has, use the length() function:\n\nlength(yield); length(Site)\n\n[1] 288\n\n\n[1] 288\n\n\n\nSort a Vector\n\nTo sort items in a vector alphabetically or numerically, use the sort() function:\n\nsort(yield)  # sort a number\n\n  [1] 0.83 0.88 1.06 1.14 1.22 1.27 1.28 1.30 1.30 1.34 1.36 1.40 1.45 1.48 1.52\n [16] 1.55 1.58 1.60 1.60 1.64 1.66 1.68 1.69 1.70 1.72 1.73 1.74 1.74 1.76 1.82\n [31] 1.83 1.86 1.94 1.95 1.96 1.96 1.97 1.98 2.00 2.01 2.02 2.04 2.04 2.05 2.05\n [46] 2.05 2.06 2.07 2.08 2.08 2.10 2.11 2.14 2.15 2.16 2.16 2.17 2.18 2.18 2.18\n [61] 2.25 2.28 2.34 2.35 2.37 2.39 2.41 2.41 2.43 2.44 2.44 2.46 2.51 2.56 2.57\n [76] 2.72 2.73 2.75 2.76 2.77 2.78 2.84 2.86 2.87 2.87 2.88 2.88 2.88 2.89 2.90\n [91] 2.90 2.91 2.92 2.92 2.94 2.97 3.00 3.01 3.02 3.05 3.08 3.10 3.13 3.13 3.14\n[106] 3.16 3.18 3.20 3.22 3.24 3.24 3.24 3.25 3.33 3.36 3.38 3.41 3.42 3.44 3.44\n[121] 3.45 3.45 3.45 3.49 3.50 3.55 3.56 3.58 3.61 3.69 3.70 3.70 3.72 3.75 3.84\n[136] 3.88 3.88 3.88 3.90 3.91 3.92 3.92 3.92 3.93 3.94 3.94 3.95 3.98 4.02 4.04\n[151] 4.06 4.14 4.16 4.16 4.20 4.26 4.28 4.33 4.34 4.36 4.36 4.36 4.36 4.39 4.42\n[166] 4.42 4.43 4.44 4.44 4.46 4.47 4.50 4.55 4.56 4.56 4.57 4.58 4.59 4.61 4.66\n[181] 4.68 4.71 4.74 4.74 4.75 4.76 4.78 4.81 4.90 4.94 4.94 4.94 4.94 4.96 4.96\n[196] 4.98 5.00 5.02 5.05 5.11 5.12 5.19 5.24 5.25 5.26 5.26 5.26 5.26 5.27 5.28\n[211] 5.28 5.31 5.32 5.36 5.40 5.40 5.42 5.45 5.46 5.52 5.53 5.56 5.57 5.61 5.62\n[226] 5.65 5.68 5.72 5.74 5.74 5.77 5.78 5.80 5.80 5.80 5.83 5.86 5.87 5.94 5.96\n[241] 5.96 5.98 6.02 6.03 6.07 6.09 6.10 6.12 6.16 6.18 6.18 6.19 6.24 6.31 6.35\n[256] 6.35 6.39 6.41 6.47 6.48 6.48 6.56 6.58 6.60 6.61 6.61 6.71 6.74 6.75 6.75\n[271] 6.87 6.87 6.90 6.92 7.04 7.18 7.20 7.28 7.36 7.39 7.45 7.52 7.53 7.55 7.56\n[286] 7.78 7.87\n\nsort(Site)  # Sort a character\n\n  [1] \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\"\n [11] \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\"\n [21] \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\"\n [31] \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\"\n [41] \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\"\n [51] \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\"\n [61] \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\"\n [71] \"LFAN\" \"LFAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\"\n [81] \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\"\n [91] \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\"\n[101] \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"NSAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\"\n[111] \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\"\n[121] \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\"\n[131] \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\"\n[141] \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"ORAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\"\n[151] \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\"\n[161] \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\"\n[171] \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\" \"OVAN\"\n[181] \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\"\n[191] \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\"\n[201] \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\"\n[211] \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"TEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\"\n[221] \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\"\n[231] \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\"\n[241] \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\"\n[251] \"WEAN\" \"WEAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\"\n[261] \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\"\n[271] \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\"\n[281] \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\" \"WLAN\"\n\n\n\nAccess Vectors\n\nYou can access the vector items by referring to its index number inside brackets [].

Each vector is a single data type, but different columns can be different data types. This is similar to a typical workbook you might open in Excel or another spreadsheet program. These can be only one column wide, but they often consist of more than that.\nIn this example, data1 is a data frame which consists of different vectors (site, block, yield,…)\nWe can create an example data frame using yield and Site variables\n\nd1 &lt;- data.frame(yield, Site)\nhead(d1)\n\n  yield Site\n1  4.96 DBAN\n2  3.94 DBAN\n3  6.35 DBAN\n4  5.56 DBAN\n5  5.36 DBAN\n6  6.18 DBAN\n\n\nA data frame has attributes for:\n\nnrow number of rows\nncol number of columns\ncolnames column names\nrownames row names (if none are provided, R will generate integer row names starting at 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhile duplicate column names in a data frame are allowed, they are not advised, and may throw an error during data import, depending on the import function used.\n\n\nCheck the number of rows and columns in a data frame:\n\nnrow(data1)\n\n[1] 288\n\nncol(data1); length(data1)\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n[1] 8\n\ndim(data1) # tells us row and column lengths in one command\n\n[1] 288   8\n\n\n\nrownames(data1)\n\n  [1] \"1\"   \"2\"   \"3\"   \"4\"   \"5\"   \"6\"   \"7\"   \"8\"   \"9\"   \"10\"  \"11\"  \"12\" \n [13] \"13\"  \"14\"  \"15\"  \"16\"  \"17\"  \"18\"  \"19\"  \"20\"  \"21\"  \"22\"  \"23\"  \"24\" \n [25] \"25\"  \"26\"  \"27\"  \"28\"  \"29\"  \"30\"  \"31\"  \"32\"  \"33\"  \"34\"  \"35\"  \"36\" \n [37] \"37\"  \"38\"  \"39\"  \"40\"  \"41\"  \"42\"  \"43\"  \"44\"  \"45\"  \"46\"  \"47\"  \"48\" \n [49] \"49\"  \"50\"  \"51\"  \"52\"  \"53\"  \"54\"  \"55\"  \"56\"  \"57\"  \"58\"  \"59\"  \"60\" \n [61] \"61\"  \"62\"  \"63\"  \"64\"  \"65\"  \"66\"  \"67\"  \"68\"  \"69\"  \"70\"  \"71\"  \"72\" \n [73] \"73\"  \"74\"  \"75\"  \"76\"  \"77\"  \"78\"  \"79\"  \"80\"  \"81\"  \"82\"  \"83\"  \"84\" \n [85] \"85\"  \"86\"  \"87\"  \"88\"  \"89\"  \"90\"  \"91\"  \"92\"  \"93\"  \"94\"  \"95\"  \"96\" \n [97] \"97\"  \"98\"  \"99\"  \"100\" \"101\" \"102\" \"103\" \"104\" \"105\" \"106\" \"107\" \"108\"\n[109] \"109\" \"110\" \"111\" \"112\" \"113\" \"114\" \"115\" \"116\" \"117\" \"118\" \"119\" \"120\"\n[121] \"121\" \"122\" \"123\" \"124\" \"125\" \"126\" \"127\" \"128\" \"129\" \"130\" \"131\" \"132\"\n[133] \"133\" \"134\" \"135\" \"136\" \"137\" \"138\" \"139\" \"140\" \"141\" \"142\" \"143\" \"144\"\n[145] \"145\" \"146\" \"147\" \"148\" \"149\" \"150\" \"151\" \"152\" \"153\" \"154\" \"155\" \"156\"\n[157] \"157\" \"158\" \"159\" \"160\" \"161\" \"162\" \"163\" \"164\" \"165\" \"166\" \"167\" \"168\"\n[169] \"169\" \"170\" \"171\" \"172\" \"173\" \"174\" \"175\" \"176\" \"177\" \"178\" \"179\" \"180\"\n[181] \"181\" \"182\" \"183\" \"184\" \"185\" \"186\" \"187\" \"188\" \"189\" \"190\" \"191\" \"192\"\n[193] \"193\" \"194\" \"195\" \"196\" \"197\" \"198\" \"199\" \"200\" \"201\" \"202\" \"203\" \"204\"\n[205] \"205\" \"206\" \"207\" \"208\" \"209\" \"210\" \"211\" \"212\" \"213\" \"214\" \"215\" \"216\"\n[217] \"217\" \"218\" \"219\" \"220\" \"221\" \"222\" \"223\" \"224\" \"225\" \"226\" \"227\" \"228\"\n[229] \"229\" \"230\" \"231\" \"232\" \"233\" \"234\" \"235\" \"236\" \"237\" \"238\" \"239\" \"240\"\n[241] \"241\" \"242\" \"243\" \"244\" \"245\" \"246\" \"247\" \"248\" \"249\" \"250\" \"251\" \"252\"\n[253] \"253\" \"254\" \"255\" \"256\" \"257\" \"258\" \"259\" \"260\" \"261\" \"262\" \"263\" \"264\"\n[265] \"265\" \"266\" \"267\" \"268\" \"269\" \"270\" \"271\" \"272\" \"273\" \"274\" \"275\" \"276\"\n[277] \"277\" \"278\" \"279\" \"280\" \"281\" \"282\" \"283\" \"284\" \"285\" \"286\" \"287\" \"288\"\n\ncolnames(data1)\n\n[1] \"isle\"    \"site\"    \"block\"   \"plot\"    \"trt\"     \"ears\"    \"yield\"  \n[8] \"disease\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe rownames attribute can be set, but if it is not, it is automatically created within R from 1 to the total number of rows. Row names are a tricky attribute than many packages in R do not support. A function may toss out your row names without any warning!\nIn general, I do not recommend setting the row names attribute in data frames to anything other than the default values unless a package function specifically requires it.\n\n\nWe can look at the overall structure of a data.frame with str():\n\nstr(data1)\n\n'data.frame':   288 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ isle   : chr  \"Antigua\" \"Antigua\" \"Antigua\" \"Antigua\" ...\n $ site   : chr  \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" \"DBAN\" ...\n $ block  : chr  \"B1\" \"B1\" \"B1\" \"B1\" ...\n $ plot   : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ trt    : chr  \"T111\" \"T000\" \"T311\" \"T202\" ...\n $ ears   : int  42 41 49 48 45 46 42 44 42 44 ...\n $ yield  : num  4.96 3.94 6.35 5.56 5.36 6.18 4.71 6.03 2.88 5.68 ...\n $ disease: logi  TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe data frame is the most common data structure scientists use in R."

accepts numeric/integer vectors, so you can use a sequence (3:10), or concatenated positions (c(1, 2, 5, 10)), or a combination of both (c(1:10, 13)).\nWhen indexing positions in a vector or data frame (or anything else), the amount of white space does not affect the outcome. These are equivalent: d[1,2], d[1, 2], d[ 1, 2]\n\n\n\nColumn Referencing\nData in R data frames can also be referred to by their column names using the notation dataframe$column_name:\nThis can also be used to create a new column in the data frame:\n\ndata1$var4 &lt;- seq.int(from=0, to=30, length.out=288) \n\nIn this example, a new column called “var4” was created, consisting of sequence numbers from zero to 30.\n\n\nValue replacement\nThere are likely to be moments when you want to replace values in a data frame or vector with something else. You can do that with indexing and variable assignment.\nLet’s image that we want to assign the third value in the sixth column as NA. First, we index the that position, then we assign a value to it (NA in this case):\n\ndata1[3, 6] &lt;- NA"

These are sometimes called “atomic vectors” in the R documentation.\n\nv1 &lt;- 1:10\nv2 &lt;- c(\"apples\", \"pears\", \"oranges\")\nv3 &lt;- c(1, 5, 7, 85)\n\nA vector can also consist of only one value or no value.\n\nv4 &lt;- \"violets\"\nv5 &lt;- TRUE\nv6 &lt;- NA\n\nIt has the attribute length and each item in a vector can also be named.\n\nlength(v1); length(v2); length(v3)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\nnames(v3) &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")\nv3\n\n A  B  C  D \n 1  5  7 85 \n\n\n\nAccessing items\nItems in a vector can be accessed by referencing the numeric position in the vector, starting at 1 and ending at the vector length. If a vector has length of one, it not necessary to index that.\nx[1] will access the first item in the vector, while x[5] will access the 5th element. Multiple item can be indexed: x[c(1,5)]. If an index position, it repeated, that item will be returned as often as it is called:\n\nv1[1]\n\n[1] 1\n\nv1[5]\n\n[1] 5\n\nv1[c(1,5)]\n\n[1] 1 5\n\nv1[c(1,1)]\n\n[1] 1 1\n\n\nAny collection of numbers can be used to index items in a vector:\n\nv1[c(1, 1:5)]\n\n[1] 1 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nWhat happens if a negative number is used?\n\nv1[-1]\n\n[1]  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nEverything but that index position is returned.\nWhat if you index a position that does not exist?\n\nv1[0]\n\ninteger(0)\n\nv1[20]\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nItems in a vector can also be accessed by their name:\n\nv3[\"A\"]\n\nA \n1 \n\n\nWhat happens if there are replicate names in a vector and you try to index (extract a value) for that name?\n\nnames(v3) &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\")\nv3\n\n A  B  C  A \n 1  5  7 85 \n\nv3[\"A\"]\n\nA \n1 \n\n\nOnly the first instance of a name is returned.\n\n\n\nThe data frame\nA collection of vectors all of the name length. Each vector is a single data type, but different columns can be different data types. This is similar to a typical workbook you might open in Excel or another spreadsheet program. These can be only one column wide, but they often consist of more than that.\n\nd1 &lt;- data.frame(var1 = 1:5,\n                 var2 = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"),\n                 var3 = c(\"alpha\", \"beta\", \"gamma\", \"zeta\", \"psi\"))\nd1\n\n  var1 var2  var3\n1    1    a alpha\n2    2    b  beta\n3    3    a gamma\n4    4    b  zeta\n5    5    c   psi\n\n\nNotes that is a single value is supplied for a column, it will be repeated for the entire column.\nA data frame has attributes for:\n\nnrow number of rows\nncol number of columns\ncolnames column names\nrownames row names (if none are provided, R will generate integer row names starting at 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile duplicate column names in a data frame are allowed, they are not advised, and may throw an error during data import, depending on the import function used.\n\n\nCheck the number of rows and columns:\n\nnrow(d1)\n\n[1] 5\n\nncol(d1); length(d1)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n[1] 3\n\ndim(d1) # tells us row and column lengths in one command\n\n[1] 5 3\n\n\nLook at the rownames and colnames atrributes:\n\nrownames(d1)\n\n[1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\"\n\ncolnames(d1)\n\n[1] \"var1\" \"var2\" \"var3\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe rownames attribute can be set, but if it is not, it is automatically created within R from 1 to the total number of rows. Row names are a tricky attribute than many packages in R do not support. A function may toss out your row names without any warning!\nIn general, I do not recommend setting the row names attribute in data frames to anything other than the default values unless a package function specifically requires it.\n\n\nWhat does length(d1) return? How about names(d1)?\nWe can look at the overall structure of a data.frame with View():\n\nView(d1)\n\nIf a particularly large file is loaded into R, using View() may be very slow (if you have a large number of rows) and provide an incomplete view (if you have a large number of columns). In that case, you can use str() to look at a data frame’s structure:\n\nstr(d1)\n\n'data.frame':   5 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ var1: int  1 2 3 4 5\n $ var2: chr  \"a\" \"b\" \"a\" \"b\" ...\n $ var3: chr  \"alpha\" \"beta\" \"gamma\" \"zeta\" ...\n\n\nThe data frame is the most common data structure scientists use in R\n\nAccessing items\nLike vectors, data frames can be indexed by position, except now we have two dimensions to consider. You can extract individual elements in a data frame by references the row and column position, my_dataframe[row, column].\n\nExtract the items located in the first 2 row2 and last 2 columns:\n\nVisual of what we want:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(This graphic is an overlay of green over blue, creating a dark teal color. The green represents rows indexed, the blue is columns indexed and the teal is the intersection between those two. If a color is not visible, that is because it is under the teal overlay.)\n\nd1[1:2, 2:3]\n\n  var2  var3\n1    a alpha\n2    b  beta\n\n\n\nExtract the first two rows and all of the columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd1[1:2, ]\n\n  var1 var2  var3\n1    1    a alpha\n2    2    b  beta\n\n\nWhen the column position is left empty, all columns are returned\n\nExtract the entire first column and all rows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd1[ ,1]\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nWhen the row position is left empty, all rows are returned\n\nExtract the values located in the first 2 rows and first two columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd1[1:2, 1:2]\n\n  var1 var2\n1    1    a\n2    2    b\n\n\n\nReturn everything except the third columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd1[ ,-3]\n\n  var1 var2\n1    1    a\n2    2    b\n3    3    a\n4    4    b\n5    5    c\n\n\n\nReturn everything except the first 2 rows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd1[-(1:2),  ]\n\n  var1 var2  var3\n3    3    a gamma\n4    4    b  zeta\n5    5    c   psi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to note\n\n\n\nIndexing accepts numeric/integer vectors, so you can use a sequence (3:10), or concatenated positions (c(1, 2, 5, 10)), or a combination of both (c(1:10, 13)).\nWhen indexing positions in a vector or data frame (or anything else), the amount of white space does not affect the outcome. These are equivalent: d[1,2], d[1, 2], d[ 1, 2]\n\n\n\n\nColumn Referencing\nData in R data frames can also be referred to by their column names using the notation dataframe$column_name:\n\nd1$var1\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nThe data are returned as a vector (with the typical attributes of a vector: length and names).\nThis can also be used to create a new column in the data frame:\n\nd1$var4 &lt;- 0:-4\n\nIn this example, a new column called “var4” was created, consisting of sequence numbers from zero to -4.\n\n\n  var1 var2  var3 var4\n1    1    a alpha    0\n2    2    b  beta   -1\n3    3    a gamma   -2\n4    4    b  zeta   -3\n5    5    c   psi   -4\n\n\n\n\nValue replacement\nThere are likely to be moments when you want to replace values in a data frame or vector with something else. You can do that with indexing and variable assignment.\nLet’s image that we want to assign the third value in the second column as NA. First, we index the that position, then we assign a value to it (NA in this case):\n\nd1[3, 2] &lt;- NA\n\n\n\n\nThe matrix\nA very mile-high view of the matrix is given here because you while may encounter this, it is a less commonly used data structure in R.\nLike a data frame, a matrix is a collection of vectors all the same length, except all vectors must be the same data type (e.g. numeric, character, etc).\nAn R matrix is not strictly identical to the mathematical concept of a matrix, but if you make an R matrix consisting only of numbers, it can be used like a mathematical matrix. Furthermore, there several mathematical operations that are intended to only work on matrices such as matrix pre-multiplication %*% or extraction of a diagonal from a square matrix, diag().\nA matrix lacks some of the attributes and functionality that are possible for data frames. Columns names can be given, but they cannot be used to index columns (i.e. my_matrix$col will throw an error).\nMatrices are not commonly seen in user-facing functions in R, but within R internals, they are widely used. You may occasionally come across a package requiring a matrix or perhaps you work in a math-intensive discipline where matrix operations are part of your regular work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFYI: how to make a matrix\n\n\n\n\n\nA matrix can be created by providing a vector of numbers and telling it to populate a table of given dimensions:\n\nx = 1:100\nm1 &lt;- matrix(data = x, nrow = 5, ncol = 20, byrow = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe list\nThis is the least structured and hence most flexible data structure that exists in R. A list is like a closet that happens to be filled with other objects, or your kitchen sink, or the trunk of your car. It’s a collection of objects of varying sizes, types, and so on. A vector, scalar and data frame can all be combined into a list. A list can contain other lists inside of it (although this list nesting can be cumbersome to deal with).\n\nL1 &lt;- list(v1, v2, v3, d1, m1)\nstr(L1)\n\nList of 5\n $ : int [1:10] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n $ : chr [1:3] \"apples\" \"pears\" \"oranges\"\n $ : Named num [1:4] 1 5 7 85\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"A\"\n $ :'data.frame':   5 obs. of  4 variables:\n  ..$ var1: int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\n  ..$ var2: chr [1:5] \"a\" \"b\" NA \"b\" ...\n  ..$ var3: chr [1:5] \"alpha\" \"beta\" \"gamma\" \"zeta\" ...\n  ..$ var4: int [1:5] 0 -1 -2 -3 -4\n $ : int [1:5, 1:20] 1 21 41 61 81 2 22 42 62 82 ...\n\n\nEach list item can have a name. Or not.\n\nL1 &lt;- list(\"number\" = v1, \"flower\" = v3, v4, \"df\" = d1, m1)\nnames(L1)\n\n[1] \"number\" \"flower\" \"\"       \"df\"     \"\"      \n\nstr(L1)\n\nList of 5\n $ number: int [1:10] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n $ flower: Named num [1:4] 1 5 7 85\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"A\"\n $       : chr \"violets\"\n $ df    :'data.frame': 5 obs. of  4 variables:\n  ..$ var1: int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\n  ..$ var2: chr [1:5] \"a\" \"b\" NA \"b\" ...\n  ..$ var3: chr [1:5] \"alpha\" \"beta\" \"gamma\" \"zeta\" ...\n  ..$ var4: int [1:5] 0 -1 -2 -3 -4\n $       : int [1:5, 1:20] 1 21 41 61 81 2 22 42 62 82 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you end up with too many objects in your global environment, you can always delete them with the rm() function:\nrm(myvar)\nrm(var1, var2, var3)\nIf one object ends up with the wrong name, you can copy the object to a new name and delete the old version:\nnew &lt;- old\nrm(old)\n\n\n\nAccessing items\nAs mentioned earlier, lists are relatively unstructured and follow fewer rules. You can access list items by their numeric position, list[[1]], or their name (if it exists), list$name.\n\nL1[[1]]\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nL1$df\n\n  var1 var2  var3 var4\n1    1    a alpha    0\n2    2    b  beta   -1\n3    3 &lt;NA&gt; gamma   -2\n4    4    b  zeta   -3\n5    5    c   psi   -4\n\n\nOnce a list item is accessed, the normal indexing rules apply. The 4th item in the list called “L1” is a data frame.\n\nL1[[4]]\n\n  var1 var2  var3 var4\n1    1    a alpha    0\n2    2    b  beta   -1\n3    3 &lt;NA&gt; gamma   -2\n4    4    b  zeta   -3\n5    5    c   psi   -4\n\nL1[[4]]$var1\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nL1[[4]][1:2,]\n\n  var1 var2  var3 var4\n1    1    a alpha    0\n2    2    b  beta   -1"

    "text": "Working directory and file paths\nWhile you can simulate data or load existing data sets associated with packages for your research, most of you will need to load pre-existing data sets from you computer, or a cloud server, some other external device.\nThe first thing you need to understand is the working directory and file paths. When an R session is initiated, it ascertains what the root working directory is based on the default settings for your R installation and any other.\nYou can check this with getwd(). You can set the file path relative to the current working directory or set an absolute path (that is, independent of your current directory). You can read more about absolute and relative paths here.\nWhen opening an R project (an .Rproj file), the working directory is automatically set to the directory where the .Rproj is located. Otherise, you can set the working directory using setwd() or under “Session” in the RStudio Ribbon.\n\nQuarto files and the {Here} package\nWhen working with an R notebook like a Quarto document or an Rmarkdown document, the working directory within code chunks is automatically set to where the quarto document is located on your file system. This is the case regardless of whether you set the working directory or where the .Rproj file is located.\nTo import a data set located in another directory from where the quarto document is located, you can use bash strategies for navigating up and down directory structures (e.g. “../data/somefile.csv”). Another solution is to use the here.\nThe function here() in the here package will reconstruct a path based on the system you are using (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc). Each directory must be specified and the final item specified is the file to import.\n\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere() starts at /home/runner/work/r-for-ag-scientists/r-for-ag-scientists\n\nhere(\"directory1\", \"subdirectory\", \"my_file.txt\")\n\n[1] \"/home/runner/work/r-for-ag-scientists/r-for-ag-scientists/directory1/subdirectory/my_file.txt\"\n\n\nIf you don’t want to load an entire package, but use the function from it, you can use the notation package_name::function(). The code below uses that when calling the here() function: here::here()."

But, they do generate R code that we can capture and reuse. They are handy shortcuts that I have found especially helpful when trying to import file formats I work with rarely.\n\n\n\nManual command line import\n\nUltimately, this is how anything is imported into R. As mentioned, first two options listed above are actually tools for generating code that will import a data set through the command-line!\nThere’s 4 common approaches for importing data into R:\n\nread.csv()\nread_csv()\nread_excel()\nread_delim()\n\n\nread.csv()\nA very commonly used function for reading in “comma separated values” (CSV) files. I personally like this format because it is not proprietary and is compatible across many operating systems. It also limits all sorts of extraneous formatting that itself is a barrier to reproducible research (e.g. highlighting is discarded once a CSV file is closed).\nExample usage:\n\nmycsv1 &lt;- read.csv(here::here(\"data\", \"trial_metadata.csv\"))\n\nResult:\n\nstr(mycsv1)\n\n'data.frame':   28 obs. of  13 variables:\n $ trial            : chr  \"SWIdahoCereals_HWW_PAR_2020\" \"SWIdahoCereals_SWW_PAR_2020\" \"SWIdahoCereals_H_W_PAR_2018\" \"SWIdahoCereals_SWW_PAR_2018\" ...\n $ program          : chr  \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" ...\n $ pi               : chr  \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" ...\n $ nursery          : chr  \"HWW\" \"SWW\" \"H_W\" \"SWW\" ...\n $ year             : int  2020 2020 2018 2018 2018 2018 2016 2016 2016 2017 ...\n $ location         : chr  \"Parma\" \"Parma\" \"Parma\" \"Parma\" ...\n $ grower_cooperator: chr  \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" ...\n $ irrigation       : chr  \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" ...\n $ latitude         : num  43.8 43.8 43.8 43.8 43.8 ...\n $ longitude        : num  -117 -117 -117 -117 -117 ...\n $ planting_date    : chr  \"10/7/2019\" \"10/7/2019\" \"10/25/2017\" \"10/25/2017\" ...\n $ harvest_date     : chr  \"7/21/2020\" \"7/21/2020\" \"7/17/2018\" \"7/17/2018\" ...\n $ exp_design       : chr  \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" ...\n\n\nDetails:\nread.csv() is actually a “wrapper” for another function, read.table(). It has taken read.table() and set the default arguments to work with CSV files. read.table() is a more generalized form providing more flexibility.\nThe default arguments include:\n\ncolnames = TRUE: the first row of data is assumed to be the column names * nothing in the data set will be used for row names unless we explicitly indicate so\nsep = \",\": each data point is separated from another by a comma * a newline indicator is used to separate rows of data\nna.strings = c(\"NA\", \"\"): cells with a either no data (““) or an”NA” will be treated as missing.\nif a column of data consists of non-numeric characters, that column vector will be treated as character and not a factor\n\n\n\nread_csv()\nThis function is part of readr. It has very similar functionality to read.csv(), but it parses the data a wee bit different.\nExample Usage:\nFirst, load the package readr that contains the function read_csv().\n\nlibrary(readr)\nmycsv2 &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"data\", \"trial_metadata.csv\"))\n\nRows: 28 Columns: 13\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (10): trial, program, pi, nursery, location, grower_cooperator, irrigati...\ndbl  (3): year, latitude, longitude\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nResult:\n\nstr(mycsv2)\n\nspc_tbl_ [28 × 13] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ trial            : chr [1:28] \"SWIdahoCereals_HWW_PAR_2020\" \"SWIdahoCereals_SWW_PAR_2020\" \"SWIdahoCereals_H_W_PAR_2018\" \"SWIdahoCereals_SWW_PAR_2018\" ...\n $ program          : chr [1:28] \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" \"SWIdahoCereals\" ...\n $ pi               : chr [1:28] \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" \"OWalsh\" ...\n $ nursery          : chr [1:28] \"HWW\" \"SWW\" \"H_W\" \"SWW\" ...\n $ year             : num [1:28] 2020 2020 2018 2018 2018 ...\n $ location         : chr [1:28] \"Parma\" \"Parma\" \"Parma\" \"Parma\" ...\n $ grower_cooperator: chr [1:28] \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" \"UI Parma REE Center\" ...\n $ irrigation       : chr [1:28] \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" \"irrigated\" ...\n $ latitude         : num [1:28] 43.8 43.8 43.8 43.8 43.8 ...\n $ longitude        : num [1:28] -117 -117 -117 -117 -117 ...\n $ planting_date    : chr [1:28] \"10/7/2019\" \"10/7/2019\" \"10/25/2017\" \"10/25/2017\" ...\n $ harvest_date     : chr [1:28] \"7/21/2020\" \"7/21/2020\" \"7/17/2018\" \"7/17/2018\" ...\n $ exp_design       : chr [1:28] \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" \"RCBD\" ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   trial = col_character(),\n  ..   program = col_character(),\n  ..   pi = col_character(),\n  ..   nursery = col_character(),\n  ..   year = col_double(),\n  ..   location = col_character(),\n  ..   grower_cooperator = col_character(),\n  ..   irrigation = col_character(),\n  ..   latitude = col_double(),\n  ..   longitude = col_double(),\n  ..   planting_date = col_character(),\n  ..   harvest_date = col_character(),\n  ..   exp_design = col_character()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n\nDetails:\nThis function takes similar arguments to read.csv(), although the output is more extensive.\n\nLike in read.csv(), the default separator is “,”, missing data are coded as empty string \"\" or NA and the first line is assumed to be the column header\nit does not bother with a row names attribute\nthe argument trim_ws will remove leading and trailing whitespace for data entries. So the column header ” soil pH” will become “soil pH”.\nColumn are preserved more clearly than read.csv() (including spaces and special characters). I’m honestly not fond of this behavior and usually clean up weird column names with janitor::clean_names().\n\nThe output is largely similar, although read_csv() actually parses dates, unlike read.csv().\n\n\nread_excel()\nThis function will read in MS Excel files (reliably)! It is truly amazing. For many many years, it was cumbersome and/or impossible to read Excel files direclty into R.\nExample Usage:\nLoad the package that contains the function read_excel(), readxl.\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nmyxl &lt;- read_excel(here::here(\"data\", \"field_trial_2009.xlsx\"), \n                   sheet = \"site_02\", \n                   trim_ws = TRUE, \n                   na = c(\"\", \"NA\"))\n\nResults:\n\nstr(myxl)\n\ntibble [80 × 30] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ plot    : num [1:80] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ bloc    : num [1:80] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ rep     : num [1:80] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Ptrt    : chr [1:80] \"high\" \"high\" \"high\" \"high\" ...\n $ inoc    : chr [1:80] \"myco\" \"myco\" \"myco\" \"myco\" ...\n $ Cv      : chr [1:80] \"OTIS\" \"ALPOWA\" \"BlancaG\" \"WALWORTH\" ...\n $ order   : num [1:80] 1 2 3 4 5 17 18 16 20 19 ...\n $ height  : num [1:80] 49 48.7 40.3 45.7 59 ...\n $ spikes  : num [1:80] NA 240 192 360 216 340 220 228 208 256 ...\n $ tstwt   : num [1:80] 61.9 61.2 61.3 60.6 61.7 60.2 61.2 61.2 62.1 62.1 ...\n $ HI      : num [1:80] 0.385 0.375 0.444 0.385 0.481 0.387 0.5 0.5 0.474 0.409 ...\n $ YieldKg : num [1:80] 1144 1274 1026 1026 922 ...\n $ YieldBu : num [1:80] 16.5 18.5 14.9 15.1 13.3 ...\n $ tkw     : num [1:80] 35.1 32.2 37.6 30.8 40.1 ...\n $ myco    : num [1:80] 37.5 30 35.7 15.4 14.3 ...\n $ PT1     : num [1:80] 4391 4500 4546 3436 4121 ...\n $ PT2     : num [1:80] 1040 726 605 702 1036 ...\n $ PT3     : num [1:80] 375 85.5 315.6 247.4 161.9 ...\n $ Pseeds  : num [1:80] 3182 2523 3156 3389 2473 ...\n $ cruc    : num [1:80] 6 10 4 5 2 3 9 7 39 66 ...\n $ Cu      : num [1:80] 6.11 4.72 5.99 5.69 4.48 ...\n $ Fe      : num [1:80] 46.4 27.2 46.8 36.5 34.2 ...\n $ Mn      : num [1:80] 28 21.5 28.2 28.4 23.8 ...\n $ Zn      : num [1:80] 16.2 14.2 18.3 22.1 15.1 ...\n $ Protein : num [1:80] 14.3 12.7 14.7 16.3 12 ...\n $ SDS     : num [1:80] 9.9 9.9 13.1 12.5 9.6 13.7 13.4 9.3 9.6 10.2 ...\n $ PT1_2   : num [1:80] 4371 4455 4442 3481 4146 ...\n $ PT2_2   : num [1:80] 968 659 544 635 965 ...\n $ PT3_2   : num [1:80] 387 104 328 262 179 ...\n $ Pseeds_2: num [1:80] 3103 2482 3083 3296 2434 ...\n\n\nDetails\n\nBy default, read_excel() will import the first sheet unless it named by position (e.g. 1, 2, 3) or name (like in the previous example).\nThe default argument for missing values is only an empty string \"\"\nIt returns results very similar to read_csv().\nThere is also an argument, range for setting a custom range of cells to read in.\n\n\n\nread_delim()\nFor reading in text files! It’s pretty simple. Text files are not used terribly frequently, but I see them now and then with really huge files, such as genotyping data.\n\nmytxt &lt;- read.delim(here::here(\"data\", \"genotypic_data.txt\"))\n\nDetails\nThis function is a more extensive version of read.csv(). It has a longer list of argument and slight different default values for those arguments that read.csv. Run ?write.delim in the console for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt’s useful to understand how R has read a data set into an R session. R has opened a connection to the file that you have specified, read file information into the R session using system memory (your computer’s RAM), and then closed the connection.\nThis is a one-way process from your file to R\nOnce a file is loaded and the connection closed, there is no longer any link between the object loaded into memory in R and its origin file (located on on your computer, a cloud server, etc). Any changes made to the object in R will not change the file on your computer unless you explicitly run scripts to overwrite that file. This is good thing; it gives you freedom to experiment with and manipulate an object without worrying about messing up the original file.\nWe will discuss later how to export R objects to your file system when you want to capture changes made to an object.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting Import errors\nThings frequently go wrong when importing data. This can sometimes be corrected by changing the import arguments, but often it indicates problems with the incoming data.\nSome possible errors and how to fix them:\n\nSome variables which should be numeric are characters instead. At least one item contains an unexpected character that renders that observation - and the rest of the vector - as a character. This might be two decimal points, a comma, or a “O” instead of “0”. If possible, manually inspect the data and correct the error.\nMissing data are not coded as missing. Import functions have default values for what is interpreted as missing. Check the documentation and adjust the arguments as needed to capture what code a data sets is using to indicate missing data.\n\nThe best choice is to properly arrange your data set prior to import. Broman & Woo (2018) provides some straightforward recommendations on how to manage data in spreadsheets.\n\n\nImporting Other Data types\nThe instructions provided above are for importing tabular data that is generally not “big data”.\nBig data is a subjective term that is system-dependent (and is rapidly changing as PC computing power and memory increases). Some personal computers can easily handle a 50 Mb file, while others cannot. If you are waiting more than 5 seconds for your data to import, then consider other options. A deep discussion about how to handle large data sets are beyond the scope of this workshop, but at the very minimum, consider the package data.table and its high-performance functions for reading and writing data, fread() and fwrite(). If your data sets are too big to load directly into R, consider arrow.\nYou may also be working with data types that are not strictly tabular, at least in the form they are stored on a computer. Here are some common non-tabular data types and packages to handle import of those.\n\nspatial data: sf, sp, raster\nSAS data sets: haven, haven::read_sas()\nSPSS data sets: haven, haven::read_sav()\ntabular files on Google drive: googledrive\nimage files: magick\n\n…and so much more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Test\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice test\n\nImport one of your data sets using two of the functions taught:\n\n(save your data in different format to enable this)\n\nread.csv()\nread_csv()\nread_excel()\nread.delim()\n\n\nExamine the data imported using View(imported_data). Did everything import as expected? Are your variables coded as they should be? Are numeric variables numeric? Are missing data detected as thus?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nNote how easy it is to import data from the ‘Files’ pane; navigate to the file and click on it! It’s important that that the code generated is saved so (1) you can reuse the code; and (2) so you can link the data set loaded to a set of R commands you ran should you ever need to rerun them (which is highly likely)."

    "text": "Joins\nMerging two data sets when it goes beyond a row bind can take an effort.\nAll joins follow this syntax:\n\nxxx_join(left_dataset, right_dataset)\n\nWhere “left_dataset” and “right_dataset” correspond to the left and right data sets in this diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of ‘keys’\n\n\n\nAll joins rely on “keys” to match observations. A key is a unique identifier; it is usually a unique for each row. This can be a single column or the result of multiple columns. This information is used to match information in one table (or data frame) with another. The extent to which these keys match or do not match is the essence of a merge.\n\n\nLet’s look at matches between “genotype”, “variety_trial”, and “metadata”.\nThe key between “metadata” and “variety_trial” is “trial”. There is exactly one row in the “metadata” file for each level of trial. The metadata file was designed to be like this. We did not need all those extra columns when it could be compressed into a smaller data set.\nThe file “genotype” is from a wholly different study. The extent of matches is considerably less complete than the matching between “variety_trial” and “metadata”.\n\nFull join\nAll observations are returned, regardless if matched.\nLet’s match “variety_trial” and “metadata”\n\nex_fulljoin &lt;- full_join(metadata, variety_trial, by = \"trial\")\n\ndim(ex_fulljoin)\n\n\n\ninner join\nReturns only the rows with matching information. Non-matches are filtered out of the data set.\nLet’s match “genotypes” and “variety_trial” (this will be big!).\nHow many of these match (where the key is “variety”, which matches “individual” in “genotype”)?\n\nintersect(variety_trial$variety, genotypes$individual)\n\n[1] \"Jefferson\"   \"UI Platinum\" \"LCS Star\"    \"UI Stone\"   \n\n\n\nex_innerjoin &lt;- inner_join(variety_trial, genotypes, by = join_by(\"variety\" == \"individual\"))\n\nCheck results\n\ndim(ex_innerjoin)\n\n[1]    76 10107\n\nsort(unique(ex_innerjoin$variety))\n\n[1] \"Jefferson\"   \"LCS Star\"    \"UI Platinum\" \"UI Stone\"   \n\n\nComplete this expression:\n\ntest &lt;- inner_join(genotypes, trial_1, by = join_by(         ))\n\n\n\nLeft join and right join\nPreserves all the rows in one data set and matches to that dataset in the other. In the left join, it is the first data set (the one on the left) where all the rows are kep. In the right join, it’s the data set to the right that is full preserved.\nLet’s compare the different when merging ‘trial_2’ with ‘metadata’.\n\nLeft join\n\nex_leftjoin_1 &lt;- left_join(trial_2, metadata, by = \"trial\")\nex_leftjoin_2 &lt;- left_join(metadata, trial_2, by = \"trial\")\n\n\n\nright join equivalent\n\n#ex_rightjoin_1 &lt;- right_join(metadata, trial_2, by = \"trial\")\nex_rightjoin_2 &lt;- right_join(trial_2, metadata, by = \"trial\")\n\nWhy did this error message result?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen metadata is listed first, it is expecting on one match per key. In this case, there are many matches for the column “trial” in the object “trial_2”.\n\n\n\nWhat are some relationships between these 4 joins?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nex_leftjoin_1 is the exact equivalent of ex_rightjoin_1, but the columns are in a different order.\n\nex_leftjoin_2 is the exact equivalent of ex_rightjoin_2, but the columsna are in a different order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSemi-join\nOne of my favorite joins! It does an inner join, but only return the columns for the first data set listed. It’s handy when you don’t want to generate gigantic objects.\nLet’s revisit matching “genotypes” and “variety_trial” like in the inner_join() example above.\n\nex_semijoin &lt;- semi_join(variety_trial, genotypes, by = join_by(\"variety\" == \"individual\"))\n\nHow do the dimensions of this object compare to the dimensions of ‘ex_innerjoin’?\n\n\nAnti-join\nThis is similar to semi_join(). It will return all the rows that do not match, and only the columns from the first data set mentioned.\n\nex_antijoin &lt;- anti_join(variety_trial, genotypes, by = join_by(\"variety\" == \"individual\"))\n\nDo any of the variety names match?\n\ntable(ex_antijoin$variety %in% genotypes$individual)\n\n\nFALSE \n 1806 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Test\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice test\n\nAs usual, consider how these data aggregation functions can support your own work.\n\nFor some of these exercises, you may need to use other dplyr functions.\n\nImport “weather_data.csv”. Group the data by station and year and count the number of missing data points for ‘tmax’, ‘tmin’ and ‘tavg’.\nImport “weather_data.csv”, group the data by ‘station’ and ‘julian_day’ and calculate the average minimum and maximum temperatures for the groups from ‘tmin’ and ‘tmax’. If you already imported the data set from the previous problem, you don’t need to import it again if you did not change the data set.\nImport “weather_data.csv”, calculate the difference between the ‘tmin’ and ‘tmax’ for each day. Group the data by year and return the smallest and largest differences for each year. Consider how to handle missing data. If you already imported the data set from the previous problem, you don’t need to import it again if you did not change the data set.\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\ndplyr updated!\nOne of the biggest changes is how it handles joins. It can now do some very flexible matching by numeric values, dates and other factors. More on this can be found in the documentation for join_by."

    "text": "Learning Goals\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of this lesson, you should:\n\nUnderstand what object class means and how to determine and object’s class\nUnderstand the difference between the 5 main object classes: logical, integer, numeric, character and factors.\nknow how to coerce objects from one class to another\n\n\n\n\nR is a programming language and like all programming languages, it has special conventions for defining how information is classified on your computer and what types of actions can be performed on different data types.\nMuch of this is related to your computer hardware, how computer memory is allocated for R objects and processes and so forth. You don’t need to understand the guts of this to use R (but should you ever want to learn, this is fascinating material).\nThe most common object types and the rules that govern them are described in this lesson.\n\nData types\n\nNumeric\nPreviously, we created an object in R that was a collection or sequence of numbers.\n\nx1 &lt;- 1:10\n\nThese numbers are technically integers (sometimes called “long integers”). We can also create “floating point numbers” (e.g. with precision past the decimal point):\n\nx2 &lt;- c(1.25, 2.718, 10.000)\n\nThese are also called “double precision numbers” or “double” for short.\n\n\nCharacter\nThese can also be created for character variables:\n\nx3 &lt;- \"apple\"\nx4 &lt;- c(\"orange\", \"banana\")\n\nCheck the type for each R object\n\n class(x1)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n class(x2)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n class(x3)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n class(x4)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can force a number to be a integer by adding an L to a number as long as it does not contain a decimal pont (e.g. c(0L, 1L, 2L))\n\n\nThere are two other special classes:\n\n\nLogical\n\nconsisting of TRUE and FALSE values\n\n\nx5 &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)\nclass(x5)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n\nObject type coercion\n\nR will automatically an assign an object type based on the items present within object. It will try to assign the simplest type possible. Here are the types from simplest to most complex:\n\n\\[logical &lt; integer &lt; numeric &lt; character\\]\nWhat classes do you think results from each of these?\n\nx8 &lt;- c(8, 9.2)\nx9 &lt;- c(0, 0, 0, 0)\nx10 &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, 1, 0)\nx11 &lt;- c(1, 2, \"pear\", -6:2, TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass(x8)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(x9)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(x10)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(x11)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you start importing data, you may notice variables did not come in as expected. This is due to the values in the original data file. For example, there may be a column that is only supposed to contain numeric values, yet it imported as character. The column in the file may contain something like this:\n\nc(1.3, 8, 23, \"0 (dropped sample)\", 100, 84)\n\n[1] \"1.3\"                \"8\"                  \"23\"                \n[4] \"0 (dropped sample)\" \"100\"                \"84\"                \n\n\nThis would import as character because of that one single value that is not numeric!\nYou can check if items are classified as specific types:\n\nis.numeric(x10)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis.logical(x10)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis.logical(x5)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nis.character(x4)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nObjects can be coerced with these functions:\n\nas.character(x8)\nas.logical(x10)\nas.numeric(x11)\n\n\n\nSpecial object type: The Factor\nThis is a very unusual data type that is specific to R and its history as a language for statistical analysis.\n\n\nFUN Fact\nR’s predecessor, “S”, was invented at Bell Labs for doing data analysis\n\nFactors look like a character variable:\n\nf1 &lt;- factor(c(\"blue\", \"blue\", \"purple\", \"green\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"green\"))\nf1\n\n[1] blue   blue   purple green  green  yellow green \nLevels: blue green purple yellow\n\n\nIt is a character variable, with pre-defined levels that are alphabetized. The text “Levels: …” are the predefined levels associated with that factor. Let’s compare this to a character variable by manually converting it to character.\n\nas.character(f1)\n\n[1] \"blue\"   \"blue\"   \"purple\" \"green\"  \"green\"  \"yellow\" \"green\" \n\n\nIn the character type, all the observations are in quotes and there is no “Level” information.\nLike other data types, you can manually coerce a fabric as thus:\n\nas.factor(x4)\n\n[1] orange banana\nLevels: banana orange\n\n\nUnder the hood, deep in the R internals, these are integers. The first factor level is designated 1, the second level is designated 2 and so forth. This order is set alphanumerically, but it can be manipulated by hand (run ?factor in the console for more information on how to do this).\n\nas.integer(f1)\n\n[1] 1 1 3 2 2 4 2\n\n\nFactors are used in statistical analysis and can be manipulated in several ways. To a large extent, you can ignore factors. However, you will see them referred to in R functions occasionally. It’s good to know they exist and the very basics of how they work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nLook at the object created in the lesson in the Global Environment pane. For each object, the object class and the first few values will be listed."

It’s my understanding that there is some regret over this style decision by the ggplot authors, but it is now an accepted convention.\nggplot2 also uses non-standard evaluation, so, often column names do not need to be quoted\n\ncommon mapping aesthetics:\n\nx (the x variable)\n\ny (the y variable)\n\ncol (color for lines, points, outlines)\n\nfill (color when something has a fill color such as a boxplot)\n\ngroup (when a plotted option should be grouped, then plotted)\n\n\n\n\n\nbuild a simple plot\nGoal: plot yield over time for hay production in Idaho\nHere is what the final plot will look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Add the data\n\nggplot(hay_idaho)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is not much to see here since we have not specified anything beyond the data set to use.\n\n\nStep 2: Add aesthetics\n\nggplot(hay_idaho, mapping = aes(x = year, y = yield))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step mapped “year” and “yield” from the hay_idaho data set to the x and y axes, respectively. Nothing is plotted because we have not specified what type of plot geom we want.\n\n\nStep 3: Add a geom\n(explicit mapping command dropped - use a positional argument instead)\n\nggplot(hay_idaho, aes(x = year, y = yield)) +\n  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can ignore this warning telling us there is missing data.

These two examples are equivalent:\nexample\nggplot(mydata, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_line()\nexample 2\nggplot(mydata) +\n  geom_line(aes(x, y))\nThe aes() argument is sometimes specified within a geom if a particular aesthetic changes between geom (e.g. the fill aesthetic changes). Otherwise, the default aesthetic is whatever was previously specified.\n\n\n\n\nhistograms and density plots:\n\nggplot(hay_idaho, aes(x = yield)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"gray70\", col = \"black\", bins = 20, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike in base R plotting, creating a density plot and shading the are under the curve is easy.\n\nggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = yield, fill = state)) +\n  geom_density(na.rm=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, it is hard to see what is going on since the each distribution covers up the one plotted before it (so we can’t really see Idaho, but Washington’s hay yield distribution is clear). The attribute “alpha” can be used to add a transparency to colors. The code is alpha =  n where n is the proportion of the color that is shown (0 is completely transparent and 1 is no transparency).\n\nggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = yield, fill = state)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining geoms\nGeoms are best thought of as plotting layers. Additional geoms can be added to a single plot, adding additional layers of information. Each geom is added to the plot in the order it is specified in the ggplot statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding an overall of points over boxplots is a good way to summarise the empirical distribution of a large number of data points:\n\nggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = state, y = yield, fill = state)) +\n  geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  ggtitle(\"Yearly hay yields in the Pacific Northwest\") + \n  xlab(\"State\") +\n  ylab(\"yield (1000s of tons)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, it is likely there is over-plotting of data since each state has 104 data point associated with it. The geom geom_jitter() can be used to jiggle overlapping points. Points can be jittered in the vertical and horizontal direction. In this case, jittering in the horizontal direction will result in no change in the interpretation since the y-axis indicates actual value associated with each point.\n\nggplot(hay_pnw, aes(x = state, y = yield, fill = state)) +\n  geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0, na.rm = TRUE, alpha = 0.7) +\n  ggtitle(\"Yearly hay yields in the Pacific Northwest\") + \n  xlab(\"State\") +\n  ylab(\"yield (1000s of tons)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther common plotting options\n\nFaceting\nSometimes, it is useful to create a set of similar plots with the same scaling.

We can create a sequence of numbers by wrapping them all in c() command (for “concatenate”) and separating each with a comma.\n\nc(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)\n\n [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\n\nThen those numbers can be operated on by any math operator:\n\nc(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20) * 10 - 1\n\n [1]  99 109 119 129 139 149 159 169 179 189 199\n\n\nThere’s also a quicker way to specify a sequence of integers using the notation start:end:\n\n1:10\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nIt also counts down:\n\n20:10\n\n [1] 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10\n\n\nAnd works with negative integers:\n\n-5:5\n\n [1] -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5\n\n\nThese can be operated on:\n\n(-5:5)^2\n\n [1] 25 16  9  4  1  0  1  4  9 16 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nCheck the “History” tab in the upper right hand pane (this should be to the right of the “Environment” tab).

    "text": "Learning Goals\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of this lesson, you should:\n\nunderstand how to assign variables and collections of numbers to an object name\nknown the rules for how to name objects\nunderstand reserved words in R and how to find them\nunderstand how white space functions in R\n\n\n\n\n\nObject assignment\nIt is rather cumbersome to continually retype numbers, even while using a shortcut. There’s a general rule of “DRY” when coding, which means “Don’t repeat yourself”. We can avoid this by assigning these numbers to an R object.\nTraditionally, the left arrow is used for object assignment, &lt;- (less than symbol + a dash), but the standard equals sign, = also works. These are equivalent:\n\nx &lt;- 1\nx = 1\n\nWe can assign multiple numbers to an object\n\nx_vector &lt;- 1:10\ny_vector &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n\nThe left arrow assignment &lt;- takes everything on the right side of the arrow and assigns it the object name on the left.\n\n\nObject naming\nIt is your choice (mostly) about what to name R objects. There are a few rules to follow:\n\nspaces are generally not allowed and a huge pain - avoid at all costs!\nDon’t start with a number or symbol! (this is technically possible, but a huge pain)\nchoose a name that is short, yet descriptive\nR is case sensitive, so test is different from Test and TEST. Be mindful of this! It trips many folks up.\n\nIt’s possible that you will thank yourself for using lowercase and avoiding special symbols (aside from . and _)\nif you start a function name with a “.” (e.g. .variable), you won’t see it listed in the global environment (which can be frustrating), this is not recommended for newer R users\nyou cannot use “reserved words” from the R language (terms set aside for very specific purposes in R). When typing these in an R console, they usually light up in a special colors.\n\nHere is some discussion on object naming in R.\n\n\nReserved words\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreserved word\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\nTRUE FALSE\nlogical\n\n\nNA\nmissing value\n\n\nNaN\nnot a number/undefined\n\n\nNULL\nno value/undefined\n\n\nInf -Inf\ninfinity\n\n\nfor in\nfor loops\n\n\nif else while break next repeat\ncontrol flow\n\n\nNA_integer_ NA_real_ NA_complex_ NA_character_\nmissing data by data type\n\n\n\nIt’s easy to forgot these. Run ?reserved in an R console or check here to remind yourself if need be.\nSome examples of reserved words in the wild:\n\nlog(0)\n\n[1] -Inf\n\n0/0\n\n[1] NaN\n\n2/0\n\n[1] Inf\n\n\n\n\nSome additional notes on R syntax\n\nmost often, the amount of white space does not matter.\n\nThese are the same:\n\n4/3\n\n[1] 1.333333\n\n4/    3\n\n[1] 1.333333\n\n4    /  3\n\n[1] 1.333333\n\n\nThese are also the same:\n\nlog(10)\n\n[1] 2.302585\n\nlog( 10 )\n\n[1] 2.302585\n\nlog ( 10)\n\n[1] 2.302585\n\n\n\nR expects certain things to be paired or completed before it will send it to the interpreter\nAs mentioned, earlier a hard return is sufficient to send a command to the R interpreter.\nExceptions: binary operators (= those expecting 2 numbers): +, -, *, /, ^, ==, etc\nExceptions: unclosed parentheses (), brackets [] {}, or quotes ' ' \" \". R will wait for these to be completed. A single quote must always be complemented by a second single quote, and a double quote likewise must always have a second quote to complete it. Left parentheses, curly braces, or brackets much also be accompanying by their right-sided complement.\ngood examples\n\n\n1 + 2\n{ }\n( )\n[ ]\n\"  \"\n' '\n` `\n\nbad examples\n\n\n1 + \n'\n(  } ] \n\"\n' \"\n\nthere is no difference between double and single quotes on a practical level, but R will interpret them as different commands (so a single quote cannot close a double quote). This is useful when there is nested levels of quoting (rare), and yet, it happens now and then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together"

It is the supermarket of R functionality. Like a supermarket, there are parts of RStudio you will visit frequently and parts you will rarely if ever use.

What is left is genetic marker names and the marker scores for the individual lines (each column is an genetically distinct wheat line). Using pivot_longer(), reshape this object to long so there is one column for the marker name, one column for the wheat name, and the one column for the marker score. How many rows long is this object? Can you image trying to do this by hand??\nImport “weather_data.csv”. Filter to any single year and reshape the data from long to wide so that the levels in “station’ form the new column headers, ‘julian_day’ is the identifying column and the cells are filled with data from ‘tmax_F’.\nHere is a crazy extra exercise that utilizes transpose instead of pivoting. It’s not strictly related to reshaping. Only try this if you are in the mood for a challenge.\n\nThis problem is indicative of a data wrangling you can experience out in the wild. You are given a data set in one format, but a package requires your data be in another format.\nThe file “genotypic_data.txt” is a transposed version of “genotypic_data_rotated.csv”. Import “genotypic_data.txt” into R and use R commands to recreate “genotypic_data_rotated.csv”.\nThe column “individual” no longer has periods in the listed names, but the original file had periods in those names since they were column headers. Write code to remove those periods from the column “individual” in your transformed column (hint: look at the documentation for gsub()).\nSolution"

It took me several tries to get it right. If you have trouble, take the exercise one step at a time, troubleshooting each step separately. It’s helpful to write down - with a pen and paper - what it is you want to do and how you think you might do this.\nThe function abs() was used to find the absolute difference. If both daily temperatures were negative, then the overall difference was negative, which ended up being the ‘minimum’, although by minimum difference, I was actually thinking about what was closest to zero. When there were wide swings in daily temperature, how big were they? And conversely, how small could these daily swings be?\nWriting down the exact problem you want to solve and how you want to solve it (the steps you want to take) can help you focus on what code is required to complete those steps. New programmers often merge the steps of how to fix a problem along with the effort required to write and troubleshoot code, which can quickly lead to distraction and feeling overwhelmed. One thing at a time, my peeps!"
